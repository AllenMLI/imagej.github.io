[[Image:SimpleNeuriteTracer2.png|thumb|600px|Simple Neurite Tracer: This image shows traced neurons in an adult <i>Drosophila</i> brain.  Neurites were reconstructed using the Simple Neurite Tracer.  The neuropil regions were segmented in the [[Segmentation Editor]] and added to the viewer with [[Show Color Surfaces]].]]

__NOTOC__

<br style="clear: both" />The main documentation for this plugin can be found at: http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s9808248/imagej/tracer/

To help you to get started with using this plugin, there is an explanatory screencast here: http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s9808248/imagej/tracer/new-instructions.html

=== Introduction ===

This plugin is designed to allow easy semi-automatic tracing of neurons or other tube-like structures (e.g. blood vessels) through 3D image stacks.  The plugin has built-in tools for analysis and hardware accelerated 3D visualization of the results.  Data can be imported and exported in SWC files for interaction with other software, or details of the traces can be exported as CSV files for analysis in spreadsheets or statistical software.  The native file format is open and XML-based.  This plugin is Free Software (also known as Open Source software) - to obtain the source code, please see [[Downloading_and_Building_Fiji_From_Source]].

=== Licensing ===

This plugin is free software, licensed under the GNU GPL v3 (with the exception of the pal source files, which are covered by the GNU LGPL) so please do contribute any patches or suggestions that you think would be useful. Please email me at mark-imagej@longair.net with any feedback.

=== Installation ===

Simple Neurite Tracer is distributed as part of Fiji - to install it, please [[Downloads|download Fiji]] and run "Help > Update Fiji" to make sure that you have the most recent version.  You can find the plugin in "Plugins > Segmentation > Simple Neurite Tracer" (or by bringing up the [[Using the Command Launcher|Command Finder]] and typing 'neurite tracer'.



The plugin GUI (left) guides the user into creating paths semi-automatically, by clicking starting and ending points throughout the stack. Any ending point serves as starting point for a new segment of the same trace, unless the trace is declared complete.  Paths can start and / or end on any other path in order to create a branching structure.

The "Pick Sigma and Maximum" window can be brought up by clicking on the "Pick Sigma Visually" button.  This provides an easy way to choose parameters that affect the diameter of tube-like structures that "Hessian based analysis" option picks out.

In the center, the image stack is shown in the XY plane with all traces in the volume projected onto that slice.

On the right, the ongoing tracing is shown in the context of the 3D volume view of the stack (via [[3D Viewer]] plugin). From the [[3D Viewer]], traces can be exported as meshes in wavefront or DXF formats for further processing in 3D applications like [http://www.blender.org Blender].
