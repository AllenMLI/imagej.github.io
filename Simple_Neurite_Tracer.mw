{{ComponentStats:sc.fiji:Simple_Neurite_Tracer}}
The ImageJ framework for semi-automated tracing of neurons and tubular structures.
{{TOC}}


== Introduction ==
SNT is designed to allow easy semi-automatic tracing of neurons or other tube-like structures (e.g., blood vessels) through 3D image stacks. The plugin has built-in tools for analysis and hardware accelerated 3D visualization of the results. Data can be imported and exported in SWC files for interaction with other software, or details of the traces can be exported as CSV files for analysis in spreadsheets or statistical software.  The [[#Technical Documentation|native file format]] is open and XML-based.  This plugin is Free Software (also known as Open Source software).

{{Tip | tip = You need a [[#Installation|Java 8-enabled installation]] to run the latest version of SNT. If you are not familiar with the plugin, have a look at its [[Simple Neurite Tracer: Introductory Screencast|Introductory Screencast]] and [[#Tutorials|Tutorials]].}}

== Installation ==
SNT is part of Fiji and distributed through the Java 8 [[How_to_follow_a_3rd_party_update_site#Add_update_sites | update site]]. If you are not running a Java 8 -enabled installation you should [[Downloads|download the latest Fiji release]]. Newer releases come pre-bundled with Java 8, and are already subscribed to the [[User:Java-8|Java-8 update site]]. Once installed you should run {{bc | Help | Update Fiji}} to make sure that you have the most recent version.  You can find the plugin in {{bc | Plugins | NeuroAnatomy | SNT}} (or by bringing up the [[Using the Command Launcher|Command Finder]] and typing {{key press|SNT}} ).

== Feedback ==
Please report any bugs that you find in the [https://forum.image.sc/tags/snt forum] or on [https://github.com/fiji/Simple_Neurite_Tracer/issues GitHub].

'''Other Material:'''
:There are also a couple of older screencasts available - these refer to obsolete pre-release versions, but most of the functionality demonstrated is still present:
* [[Simple Neurite Tracer: Old Screencast1]]
* [[Simple Neurite Tracer: Old Screencast2]]

== Technical Documentation ==
The native file format of the plugin is documented at: [[Simple Neurite Tracer: .traces File Format]]. (<code>.traces</code> files are just gzipped XML, so easy to parse.)  There's also an example {{GitHub|org=tferr|repo=hIPNAT|path=src/main/resources/scripts/|label=script}} on the [[Neuroanatomy]] update site showing how to batch convert each .traces file to multiple SWC files.

SNT is also easy to use programmatically. For instance, the example in {{GitHub|org=fiji|repo=Simple_Neurite_Tracer|source=tracing/Albert_Test.java|label=Albert_Test.java}} shows how to use the code to find a path between two arbitrary points in an image stack.

As another small example, if you just wanted to load a set of SWC files using the SNT API and display them in the 3D viewer (a functionality provided by the [[Neuroanatomy]] update site, through a {{GitHub|org=tferr|repo=hIPNAT|path=src/main/java/ipnat/|label=Java plugin}}), a Jython script like [https://gist.github.com/838695 this] will do.

== Authors ==
The current version was written by [[User:Tiago|Tiago Ferreira]]. The first release of Simple Neurite Tracer was written by [[User:Mark|Mark Longair]] except for the following important sections, released under the GPL:
* The code for doing Gaussian convolutions of the image and the calculation of principal curvatures was written by [[User:StephanP|Stephan Preibisch]].
* The code for loading AmiraMesh label files was written by [[User:Schindelin|Johannes Schindelin]].
* The code for generating meshes of neurons for the 3D viewer was originally written by [[User:Albertcardona|Albert Cardona]] for [[TrakEM2]].
* This plugin also incorporates code from the LGPL licensed PAL library, although the functionality that relies on this is not currently exposed. 


== Acknowledgments ==
This software was first developed during [[User:Mark|Mark Longair]]'s PhD, funded by the [http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/ResearchFunding/Programmes/LifeSciencesInterface/ EPSRC / MRC life sciences interface programme], and in particular the [http://www.anc.inf.ed.ac.uk/neuroinformatics/ Doctoral Training Centre in Neuroinformatics at the University of Edinburgh]. A substantial part of the later development of this plugin was done during the [http://www.hhmi.org/janelia/ Janelia Farm] Hackathon of 2007. Citing Mark: "I owe a debt of thanks to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute for making it possible for me to go to that event. Thank-you also to Arnim Jenett, Adrianna Teriakidis and Benny Lam for their feedback and help with testing various versions of this plugin".
