To help you to get started with using this plugin, there is an explanatory screencast here: 

[[Image:SimpleNeuriteTracer.jpg|thumb|700px|Simple Neurite Tracer: neurites were reconstructed using the Simple Neurite Tracer.  The neuropil regions were segmented in the [[Segmentation Editor]] and added to the viewer with [[Show Color Surfaces]].]]

The plugin GUI (left) guides the user into creating paths semi-automatically, by clicking starting and ending points throughout the stack. Any ending point serves as starting point for a new segment of the same trace, unless the trace is declared complete.  Paths can start and / or end on any other path in order to create a branching structure.

In the center, the image stack is shown in the XY plane with all traces in the volume projected onto that slice.

On the right, the ongoing tracing is shown in the context of the 3D volume view of the stack (via [[3D Viewer]] plugin). From the [[3D Viewer]], traces can be exported as meshes in wavefront or DXF formats for further processing in 3D applications like [http://www.blender.org Blender].
