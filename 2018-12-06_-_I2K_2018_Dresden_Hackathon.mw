From Monday, December 3, 2018 through Friday, December 7, 2018, the [https://mpi-cbg.de/ Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics] hosts ~10 developers at the [http://www.csbdresden.de/ Center for Systems Biology] in Dresden, Germany for a [[hackathon]] to develop KNIME Image Processing and [[ImageJ2]]/[[Fiji]] core infrastructure and [[plugins]].

Gitter channel: https://gitter.im/juglab/Hack1812

== Topics / Technical Discussions ==

=== Labkit as Labeling Editor for KNIME Image Processing ===

* Node for editing labels in KNIME based on [[Labkit]] was created.
* Work is not entirely finish. We plan to finish this work during the  Ostrava Hackathon.
* Labkit was extended, and is now able to handle multiple images.
* A labeling datatype to store labels, and track modifications was developed.

=== Simple ImageJ API ===

* Discussion between: Deborah, Robert, Curtis, Matthias
* How can we make the scripting in ImageJ2 easier?
* Setup a table, of scripting examples in IJ1 and IJ2. Improve the IJ2 API where ever it's obviously required.
* Write a SimpleIJ gateway, that provides really simple methods for the most frequent tasks in ImageJ.
* A ImageJ2 script recorder could improve the IJ2 API, as it clearly shows where the API is to verbos. 

=== Big Data Server ===

* Discussion Tobias, Gabriella and Matthias about a mechanism for secure user authentication in Big Data Server (and ImageJ Server).
* It's needed by biologists, that want to share there data with specific users.
* ImageJ Server would also benefit, if the access to the API could be authenticated in a similar way.

=== Octtree Like, Compressed, Fast, Bitmaps for Imglib2 ===

* Tobias develops a data structure to store bitmap. For iteration, efficient pixels access and little memory foot print at the same time.
* Such data structures can be used to better express labels in imglib2. Even instance segmentations that consist of millions of labels, can be accessed efficiently if a cell image like cache is used.
