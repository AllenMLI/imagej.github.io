We have a modified ImageJ core that operates as Fiji's kernel.
The source code is in a branch named 'fiji' in ImageJA repository.

Here is how to get fiji's ImageJA branch to run Fiji:

First go to fiji/ImageJA directory:

 $ cd ImageJA/

Then fetch all remote sources:

 $ git fetch

Then list all branches, local and remote, just to be sure. Note a branch named 'origin/fiji':

 $ git branch -r
  origin/HEAD
  origin/fiji
  origin/headless
  origin/hltemp
  origin/ij-singleton
  origin/imagej
  origin/imageja
  origin/master
  origin/mob
  origin/obsolete/fontmetrics
  origin/plugin-paths
  origin/roi-changed
  origin/tools

Note that we have checked out the master branch:

 $ git branch
  * master

... but we want the fiji branch. Here is how:

 $ git checkout -b fiji origin/fiji

Now we are tracking locally two branches: the master (ImageJA naked, very close to official ImageJ), and fiji's branch:

 $ git branch
  * fiji
    master

So, change directories up to fiji's main directory, and just type 'make':

 $ cd ..
 $ make

Done!
