{{Logo | ImageJ1 | size=24px}} BoneJ was designed to work with plain [[ImageJ 1.x]].

{{Logo | Fiji | size=24px}} BoneJ can be installed into [[Fiji]], but you must '''use the Java-6 version of Fiji, not the current Java-8 version''':

* Download the final Java-6 version of Fiji labeled “2017 May 30” from [[Fiji/Downloads#Java_6|here]].
* Unpack it somewhere beneath your home folder.
* Download and install <code>BoneJ_.jar</code> into that installation's <code>plugins</code> folder.
* Launch Fiji and run {{bc | Plugins | 3D Viewer}} to trigger installation of the [[3D Viewer]].
* Restart Fiji.

For technical details about ImageJ and Fiji using Java 6 vs. Java 8, see the [[Java 8]] page.
