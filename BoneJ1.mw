}}BoneJ is a plugin for bone image analysis in [[ImageJ]]. It provides free, open source tools for trabecular geometry and whole bone shape analysis.

== Current release ([[BoneJ2]]) ==

There's a new modernized version of BoneJ available through the ImageJ [https://imagej.net/Updater updater]. Read more about [[BoneJ2]].

== Legacy (BoneJ v1.x) Installation ==

{{Logo | ImageJ1 | size=24px}} BoneJ was originally designed to work with plain [[ImageJ 1.x]].

{{Logo | Fiji | size=24px}} BoneJ can be installed into [[Fiji]], but you must '''use the Java-6 version of Fiji, not the current Java-8 version''':

* Download the final Java-6 version of Fiji labeled “2017 May 30” from [[Fiji/Downloads#Java_6|here]].
* Unpack it somewhere beneath your home folder.
* Download and install <code>BoneJ_.jar</code> into that installation's <code>plugins</code> folder.
* Launch Fiji and run {{bc | Plugins | 3D Viewer}} to trigger installation of the [[3D Viewer]].
* Restart Fiji.

For technical details about ImageJ and Fiji using Java 6 vs. Java 8, see the [[Java 8]] page.

== BoneJ and pQCT ==

BoneJ and pQCT plug-ins are in the process of separation. The latter have their own [https://imagej.net/PQCT| update site], and they don't need BoneJ to work. However, if you download <code>BoneJ_.jar</code> from [http://bonej.org/ http://bonej.org/] it still includes older versions of the pQCT tools.
