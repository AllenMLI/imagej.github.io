The Radial Symmetry plugin can be downloaded from the [http://sites.imagej.net/milkyklim update site]. After that it will appear in the 'Plugins' menu under 'Radial Symmetry Localization'.

The source code is available on Github, please, also post feature requests & bug reports there.

Please note that the Radial Symmetry plugin available through Fiji, is based on a publication. If you use it successfully for your research please be so kind to cite our work:

<will be released soon>

== Introduction == 

The Radial Symmetry Localization plugin enables users to find the smFISH spots with the super resolved accuracy. The software is designed for different types of imaging and is applicable to 2D/3D images together with the time-dimension. 

How is it combined with the outlier removal (RANSAC)?  

== Detailed Tutorial ==

Using the software package consists of the several steps. Please note that this is just a suggestion of how to use the package in the more-or-less standard case. 

''' Fixing the Image Anisotropy '''

In the first step, one have choose the image that will be used for the parameters adjustment.

Normally, you will use the bead images acquired with the same microscope as the normal images.  

Open the image and navigate to the 'Plugins' menu under 'Radial Symmetry Localization' > 'Calculate Anisotropy Coefficient'. 

Choose the Image for Detection that was opened and Gaussian Fit (gives better result) as a Detection Method.

After that press ok. 

Adjust Sigma and Threshold values so that only beads are detected.

Press ok. 

The calculations might take some time. The program will calculate the corresponding scale value which basically shows how we should squeeze the objects in z-direction to make them look round. 

This step is not 100% necessary but will improve you detections further on when you switch to the real data. 

''' Localizing Spots '''

There are 2 different types of processing images interactive and manual. The first one is used to adjust the the parameters for further batch processing. Moreover, it provides the visual feedback necessary to adjust the parameters for the automated detection on huge datasets. 

Open the image and navigate to the 'Plugins' menu under 'Radial Symmetry Localization' > 'Radial Symmetry'.

Ensure that the correct image is chosen.

There you will be asked to specify how you want to process the image and what type of output you want to get.

Choose 'Interactive' mode for now. 

Intensities Gauss fit defines if you want to perform the gaussian fitting algorithm on each of the spots that was detected. Warning: ticking this box might significantly slow down the calculations.

Use RANSAC: this box is useful in case you have noisy data. The algorithm will discard the pixels that are either to bright or too dark. Keep it ticked in general. 

Anistoropy coefficient: defines how much the z-resolutions differs from the xy-resolution. The parameter will be set automatically if you ran the 'Calculate Anisotropy Coefficient' plugin before-hand. In general, 1.0 gives the reasonable result. Warning: if you are working on 2D data you want see this checkbox. 

In the visualization section one can choose if it is necessary to show the results.

RANSAC results overlays the initial image with the regions that we used for the calculations. 

Detections: is the representation of the 3D overlay for the detected spot. 

Hit ok. 

After that you will see multiple windows

Once the parameters are adjusted hit any of the okay buttons. 

Once the calculations are done you will see the results
