== Download == 
The Radial Symmetry plugin can be downloaded from the [http://site.imagej.net/milkyklim update site]. After that it will appear in the 'Plugins' menu under 'Radial Symmetry Localization'.

The source code is available on Github, please, also post feature requests & bug reports there.

Please note that the Radial Symmetry plugin available through Fiji, is based on a publication. If you use it successfully for your research please be so kind to cite our work:

<will be released soon>

== Introduction == 

The Radial Symmetry Localization plugin enables users to find the smFISH spots with the super resolved accuracy. The software is designed for different types of imaging and is applicable to 2D/3D images together with the time-dimension. 

How is it combined with the outlier removal (RANSAC)?  

== Detailed Tutorial ==

Using the software package consists of the several steps. Please note that this is just a suggestion of how to use the package in the more-or-less standard case. 

''' Fixing the Image Anisotropy '''

In the first step, one have choose the image that will be used for the parameters adjustment.

Normally, you will use the bead images acquired with the same microscope as the normal images.  

Open the image and navigate to the 'Plugins' menu under 'Radial Symmetry Localization' > 'Calculate Anisotropy Coefficient'. 

Choose the Image for Detection that was opened and Gaussian Fit (gives better result) as a Detection Method.

After that press ok. 

Adjust Sigma and Threshold values so that only beads are detected. 

Press ok. 

The calculations might take some time. The program will calculate the corresponding scale value which basically shows how we should squeeze the objects in z-direction to make them look round. 

This step is not 100% necessary but will improve you detections further on when you switch to the real data. 

''' Localizing Spots '''

There are 2 different 

- Why do you have the parameters?
- How you can use them?
- What type of images is supported at the moment?
