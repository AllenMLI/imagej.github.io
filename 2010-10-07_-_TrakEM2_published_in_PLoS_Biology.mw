Big day for Fiji. [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/wiki/index.php/TrakEM2 TrakEM2] which is a BIG part of Fiji played a central role in the paper published this week in [http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000502 PLoS Biology] titled

"An Integrated Micro- and Macroarchitectural Analysis of the Drosophila Brain by Computer-Assisted Serial Section Electron Microscopy."

It is a culmination of a long-term collaboration between researchers from the Institute of Neuroinformatics ETH Zurich ([http://albert.rierol.net Albert Cardona]), the Department of Molecular Cell and Developmental Biology UCLA ([http://www.mcdb.ucla.edu/Research/Hartenstein Volker Hartenstein]) and the MPI-CBG (particularly [http://fly.mpi-cbg.de/~saalfeld/ Stephan Saalfeld] who wrote the algorithms behind TrakEM2 registration published separately in [http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/12/i57.full?sid=8ff2b8c5-158d-461e-ab2e-b2fc5bdca5df Bioinformatics]).

All papers, software and data are Open Access showing the way of how science should be done in the 21st century. 

Congratulations to Albert Cardona, also known as the "Father of Fiji", for this <i>tour de force</i> effort!
