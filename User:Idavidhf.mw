'''Description:'''<br>
<p> This plugin uses ImageJ's particle analyzer to track <math>n</math>-objects, in vertical order, through a stack. Imposition of the real time betwen stack frame is allowabe as the output results in calibrated or uncalibrated unities. It can be customized to track the ocean wave propagations or relative measurements.</p><br>
