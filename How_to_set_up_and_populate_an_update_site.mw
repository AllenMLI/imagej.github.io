{{UpdateSites}}
== Introduction ==

This tutorial explains how to '''set up a website to distribute your plugins'''. It assumes that your plugins are correctly installed in your local ImageJ setup.

== Rationale ==

See the [[Distribution]] page for a discussion of the benefits of update sites and how they fit in to plugin development.

== Add your personal update site ==

By far the easiest method to provide your macros, scripts and plugins to other users, letting them keep up-to-date in the most convenient manner, is to set up your ''personal update site''.

A ''personal update site'' is hosted on <nowiki>http://sites.imagej.net/<imagej-wiki-account></nowiki>. If you do not have an ImageJ Wiki account yet, no need to worry, you can register one while setting up your update site.

{{Notice | There are some minimal ''Terms of Service'' for personal update sites. See the [[Update Sites#What_are_the_Terms_of_Service_for_personal_update_sites.3F|Update Sites FAQ]] for details.}}

First of all, start the updater with ''Help>Update'' and click on the ''Manage update sites'' button:

[[File:Mamed-3.jpg|770px]]

Now, click ''Add my site'', and follow the instructions for either [[#Specifying an existing ImageJ Wiki account|using an existing wiki account]] or [[#Creating a new ImageJ Wiki account|creating a new wiki account]].

=== Specifying an existing ImageJ Wiki account ===

If you already have an active ImageJ Wiki account (i.e. you changed your password from the initial temporary token) enter the name of that account and click ''OK'':

If your upload password (separate from your wiki password) was not initialized, you will then be asked to provide your wiki password, which will be used to initialize your upload password.

You can also manually [[Special:ChangeUploadPassword|change or initialize your upload password]].

=== Creating a new ImageJ Wiki account ===

Specify the desired account name. If it is taken already, you will be asked for the password (and need to cancel the dialog and start over). If the account is available, the updater will greet you with this message:

[[Image:Personal-Update-Site-2.png|770px]]

After clicking ''OK'', the updater will let you type in your name and your email address:

[[Image:Personal-Update-Site-3.png|770px]]

After you specified the information and click ''OK'', the updater will acknowledge thusly:

[[Image:Personal-Update-Site-4.png|770px]]

You should soon receive a mail notifying you about the newly created account, and a temporary password. You need to [http://imagej.net/Special:UserLogin log into the ImageJ Wiki] to reset the password:

[[Image:Personal-Update-Site-5.png|770px]]

Now you can continue in the updater: type in your password and press the ''OK'' button:

[[Image:Personal-Update-Site-6.png|770px]]

This will initialize your update site and it will be added to your list of active update sites:

[[Image:Personal-Update-Site-7.png|770px]]

Now you are ready to [[#Uploading files to your update site|upload files]]. After that, you might want to consider to add your site into the alphabetical list on [[List_of_update_sites|this page]] for the convenience of other ImageJ users (your update site will then be shown in the ''Manage update sites'' dialog by default).

== Adding an update site on your own server ==

If you have an own server or web space with WebDAV, SFTP or SSH access, you can create a directory in that web space and initialize it as an update site, too. Just call the updater with ''Help>Update'' and click the ''Manage update sites'' button:

[[File:Mamed-3.jpg|770px]]

Now press the ''Add'' button, provide a nick name for your update site, the URL of your web space, and ''upload information''.

The ''upload information'' depends on the protocol available for uploading:

{|border=1
|-
!Protocol
!Host
!Directory on Host
|-
|WebDAV
|''webdav:'', or ''webdav:<webdav-user>''
|''.''
|-
|SFTP
|''sftp:<sftp-user>@<sftp-host>''
|''<absolute-path>''
|-
|SSH
|''ssh:<ssh-user>@<ssh-host>''
|''<absolute-path>''
|-
|}

In case you want to use an SFTP/SSH server, it must have an empty, public web accessible folder where you intend to publish your updates. The ImageJ updater will not create that empty folder.

''Example:'' Let's assume you have SFTP access to a machine known as ''imagej.example.org'' to the internet, and let's assume that you have a user account ''myself'' that has write access to the path ''/var/www/my-update-site/'' on that machine that is served via http://imagej.example.org/my-update-site/. Then the line you need to add  might look like this:

{|border=1
|-
!Name
!URL
!Host
!Directory on Host
|-
|My Update Site
|http://imagej.example.org/my-update-site/
|myself@imagej.example.org
|/var/www/my-update-site/
|-
|}

If the update site has not been initialized yet (i.e. if nobody else has initialized that site yet), you will see a dialog like this:

[[Image:How_to_setup_a_plugin_distribution_site-6a.jpg|center]]

Just click ''OK'' and let the updater upload an empty file index (it is stored in the file ''db.xml.gz'' which is also called the ''database'' in the documentation of the updater).

It is also possible to create an [[Group_Update_Sites|update site for a group]] to which multiple users can upload.

== Uploading files to your update site ==

Note: you cannot simply copy files to your web space; the updater would miss all kinds of important information, and consequently refuse to accept that update site. You '''need''' to let the updater handle the file uploading.

=== Start the [[updater]] and check your update site ===

First, start the [[updater]]:

[[Image:How_to_setup_a_plugin_distribution_site-1.jpg]]

Click on the ''Manage update sites'' button and verify:

* Your update site is present and enabled
* The ''Host'' column of your update site contains your user name, in the form: <code>webdav:<WikiUsername></code>

For example:

[[Image:Personal-Update-Site-7.png|770px]]

Once your login information is set you can ''Close'' the update site window.

=== Prepare your files for upload ===

Click on the ''Advanced mode'' button and set the view options to see your plugins:

* If your have never uploaded your plugins, select ''View local-only files''
* If you are uploading new versions of your plugins, select ''View locally modified files only''

In this case, the plugin we'll be uploading is contained in ''A_Jolly_Useful_Plugin.jar''.

Select the file to upload, click under the ''Stats/Action'' column, or right-click (on MacOSX, {{key|Ctrl}}+{{key|click}}) in any column, for the context menu and select ''Upload to <update site name>''.

[[Image:Upload-to-update-site.png|770px]]

{{Notice | The ''Upload to <update site name>'' option is only available if you entered your [[#Start the updater and check your update site|wiki credentials]] and no other changes are pending. This is to avoid potentially corrupting your ImageJ installation. If the Upload option is not available, select the ''View changes'' view and resolve any pending changes - e.g. by updating or reverting to '''Keep as-is'''.}}

When a plugin is selected, a ''Details'' panel becomes available. The plugin's dependencies, e.g. ''ij.jar'' and ''someJarOrOther.jar'', are automatically determined by the updater. Hence if you require 3rd party packages for your plugin you can place them into the jars folder of ImageJ and the updater will automatically upload them to the site.

You can also manually enter or edit any information you wish to provide about the plugin:

[[Image:How_to_setup_a_plugin_distribution_site-15.jpg|770px]]

{{Warning | Sometimes the updater will mis-detect your dependencies. This may prevent you from uploading to your update site! If a dependency is wrong, you can manually add or delete dependencies from the ''Details'' tab to correct the problem. Please [[Mailing_Lists|let us know]] when this happens so we can try to improve the updater}}

=== Upload your files ===

Finally, click ''Apply changes (upload)'' to upload your plugin to the server and allow others to access it. If you have dependencies that are not part of ImageJ, the updater will ask you if you want to upload that jar as well. Finally, you will be asked for your login credentials again and the files will be uploaded to the server. 

Check that your plugins are now registered as ImageJ plugins by selecting the ''View files of the '[your site name here]' site'' view option:

[[Image:UpdaterFinalScreen.jpg|770px]]

That's it - you're done. Now, anyone who wants a copy of your plugins merely needs to [[How to follow a 3rd party update site|add your update site]] to the Update manger via the URL you specified, and your plugins will be downloaded and updated in their ImageJ installations just like the standard ImageJ plugins.

== Publishing your update site ==

If you want to let other people know about your update site, just add it to the  [[list of update sites]].
