	Yes. Uncheck the ''Confirm temporary segments'' in the ''Options'' tab (''Temporay Paths'' section).

	<dl><dd>
	Loading of images that require input options is handled by ImageJ directly. To load a directory of images (e.g., one file per Z-slice), run {{bc|color=white|File| Import|Image Sequence}} and select the first file in the sequence, adjusting any needed parameters in the subsequent dialog prompt. Once the sequence is imported adjust voxel dimensions using {{bc|color=white|Image|Properties...}}. To save yourself from having to go through these steps again, you should save the imported stack as a single TIFF file using {{bc|color=white|File|Save As|Tiff...}}

	It is the most widely adopted format for encoding neuronal reconstructions, in which information is stored in plain text. It was first described by (Cannon et al., 1998) and since then became a somewhat loose ''lingua franca'' of a neuron's three dimensional structure. It is described in more detail [http://www.neuronland.org/NLMorphologyConverter/MorphologyFormats/SWC/Spec.html here] and [https://neuroinformatics.nl/swcPlus/ here]. SNT supports all known variants of the format including [https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017207 ESWC] and [https://neuroinformatics.nl/swcPlus/ SWC+]. The extension stems from the last names of Stockley, Wheal, and Cole, who developed a neat computer system for reconstructing neuronal cells ( Stockley et al., 1993). Confusingly, it is also a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_SWC_file deprecated file format] used by Adobe.
