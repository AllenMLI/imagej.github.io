	Yes. Uncheck the ''Confirm temporary segments'' in the ''Options'' tab (''Temporay Paths'' section).

	Righ-click on the image canvas and select ''Pause SNT'' from the contextual menu. Voxel intensities will be reported in the ImageJ status bar.

	<dl><dd>
	Loading of images that require input options is handled by ImageJ directly. To load a directory of images (e.g., one file per Z-slice), run {{bc|color=white|File| Import|Image Sequence}} and select the first file in the sequence, adjusting any needed parameters in the subsequent dialog prompt. Once the sequence is imported adjust voxel dimensions using {{bc|color=white|Image|Properties...}}. To save yourself from having to go through these steps again, you should save the imported stack as a single TIFF file using {{bc|color=white|File|Save As|Tiff...}}
