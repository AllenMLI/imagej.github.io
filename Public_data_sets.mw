Do you need image data to try your algorithms on? Do you lack expert ground truth to test your methods? No problem! Here you have a list of available public data sets from the Fiji community and other sources:

* [http://www.ini.uzh.ch/~acardona/data.html Segmented ssTEM stack of neural tissue], thanks to Albert Cardona.

:30 sections from a serial section Transmission Electron Microscopy (ssTEM) data set of the Drosophila first instar larva ventral nerve cord (VNC). The microcube measures 2 x 2 x 1.5 microns approx., with a resolution of 4x4x50 nm/pixel.
:'''The challenge''': use this data set to train machine learning software for the purpose of automatic segmentation of neural structures in ssTEM.

:The images are representative of actual images in the real-world: there is a bit of noise; there are image registration errors; there is even a small stitching error in one section. None of these led to any difficulties in the manual labeling of each element in the image stack by an expert human neuroanatomist. A software application that aims at removing or reducing human operation must be able to cope with all these issues.

* [http://loci.wisc.edu/software/sample-data Sample data at LOCI], in a variety of file formats.

* [http://ome-xml.org/wiki/OmeTiffData Sample OME-TIFF data on ome-xml.org], thanks to Josh Bembenek.

:The dataset consists of tubulin histone GFP coexpressing ''C. elegans'' embryos. All image planes were collected at 512x512 resolution in 8-bit grayscale. 

* [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/datasets/migrating-macrophages.tif.tar.bz2 Migrating macrophages] in response to stimuli.
:4D data set, kindly provided by Dirk Sieger and [http://www.embl.de/research/units/dev_biology/peri/ Francesca Peri], EMBL.[[File:Migrating-macrophages.gif|thumb]]
:'''The challenge''': trace the macrophages in 4D, and measure their shape volumes, surfaces, positions and pixel value intensities.
:The file is a tif hyperstack that can be loaded directly into the [[3D Viewer]].
