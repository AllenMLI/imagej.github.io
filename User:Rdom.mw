Richard Domander develops [[BoneJ_Experimental BoneJ]] at the RVC in London, United Kingdom. In addition to BoneJ he's contributed code to SCIFIO, AnalyzeSkeleton, ImageJ and others. He's also written tutorials about what he has learned in his role.

Richard's taken part in several of the ImageJ hackathons learning from others and having discussions about the future of the platform. He always thinks there's always something to improve in his code.
