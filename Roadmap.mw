{{Development}}ImageJ manages tasks and priorities using an online issue tracking system.

== Issue tracking ==

ImageJ is currently migrating to [https://github.com/organizations/imagej/dashboard/issues/repos GitHub Issues] for issue tracking:

* [https://github.com/imagej/imagej/issues/milestones ImageJ release milestones]
* [https://github.com/scifio/scifio/issues/milestones SCIFIO release milestones]

Previously, the project used [http://trac.imagej.net/ Trac] for issue tracking and roadmapping. See these links:

* [http://trac.imagej.net/roadmap ImageJ Trac roadmap] - early milestones
* [http://trac.imagej.net/report/1 ImageJ Features report] - a high-level list of features slated for each release
* [http://trac.imagej.net/timeline ImageJ Trac timeline] - a fine-grained list of changes to ImageJ

== Other roadmap links ==

* [[News]] about ImageJ and Fiji developments, including status updates, observations and comments about ImageJ programming.
* [[Special:RecentChanges|Recent changes]] to this web site (''not'' the ImageJ code itself).
* [http://fiji.sc/bugzilla BugZilla] database of user-reported bugs from the [[Report a Bug]] plugin.
