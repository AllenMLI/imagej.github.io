== Purpose ==

Computes the 3D discrete (values 0 to 255) distance transform, distance is distance to background. Based on the paper  [http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/cviu.1996.0065 "On digital distance transforms in three dimensions"], by Gunilla Borgefors, and code from Centrum for bildanalys, cb.uu.se. See source for more details.
