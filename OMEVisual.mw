== Presentation ==

<code>OMEVisual</code> is a Fiji plugin to easily visualize OME metadata.

Usage:

* Open your image in Fiji.
* Start the plugin with ''Plugins ► Utilities ► Visualize OME Metadata''.
* A window should open with the metadata in it.

Please note that :

* This goal of this plugin is '''not to implement''' all the OME features.
* This plugin makes several strong assumptions about the OME model in order to simplify the interface :
** Each image contains only one <code>Pixels</code> element.
** Each <code>TiffData</code> contains only one <code>Plane</code>.
** <code>Plane</code> and <code>TiffData</code> informations are displayed at the same location without distinction.
* Any ideas to improve the visualization and/or add OME features is very welcome :
** The best way is to submit a PR.
** You can also open an issue and post an OME-TIFF file which contains additional OME features you would like to see added to the plugin.
