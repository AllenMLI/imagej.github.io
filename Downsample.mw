Gaussian downsampling of an image with ImageJ on-board tools.

==Motivation==

Sound downsampling of an image requires the elimination of image frequencies higher than half the sampling frequency in the result image (see the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem Nyquistâ€“Shannon sampling theorem]).  The exclusive tool for this is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_function Gaussian convolution].

==Documentation==

This script calculates the required Gaussian kernel for a given target '''width''' or '''height''', smooths the image and resamples it.  The target size must be smaller than the source image size.

Furthermore, you can define the "intrinsic" Gaussian kernel of the source and target images.  An optimal sampler is identified by sigma=0.5.  If your source image was blurred already, you may set a higher '''source sigma''' for a sharper result.  Setting '''target sigma''' to values smaller than 0.5 makes the result appear sharper and therefore eventually aliased.

==Example==

An image says more than thousand words, so here is an example.  You see a transmission electron micrograph, of originally 2,048&times;2,048px downsampled to 100&times;100px.
