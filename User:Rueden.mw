}}Curtis Rueden directs the [http://loci.wisc.edu/software/home software development efforts] of [[LOCI]]. He is the principal architect of [[ImageJ2]], and the current maintainer of the [[Fiji]] distribution of ImageJ.

== What is Curtis working on? ==

=== Primary projects ===

Here is a summary of my current projects, in priority order. I try to keep this list up to date.

# '''[[LOCI]] web server [https://www.docker.com/ Docker]ization.'''
# '''Ops generic type matching.''' Improve the Ops type matcher to fully support generics, including recursive generics. ([https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/compare/generic-types scijava/scijava-common@generic-types], [https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops/compare/nil imagej/imagej-ops@nil])
# '''ImageJ + Java 8.''' Complete the migration to Java 8 with a Java-6-compatible stub classpath that checks your Java version and tells you how to upgrade to Java 8 if needed. Retire the Java-8 update site, distributing its contents back onto the ImageJ and Fiji update sites.
# '''Rich Image.''' Improve the [[ImageJ Common]] data model to support metadata (e.g., spatial transformations) as a first-class citizen. ([https://github.com/imagej/imagej-common/compare/rich imagej/imagej-common@rich], [https://github.com/imagej/janelia-hackathon-2016 imagej/janelia-hackathon-2016])
# '''POM unification.''' ([http://forum.imagej.net/t/split-boms-from-parent-configuration/2563 Split BOMs from parent configuration])
# '''Document community expectations.''' Formally define and clarify who is responsible for maintaining which plugins, to what extents ([http://forum.imagej.net/t/project-developer-roles/206 Project developer roles], [https://github.com/ctrueden/ctr-scripts/blob/master/dev-find ctrueden/ctr-scripts:dev-find], [https://github.com/fiji/fiji/blob/master/bin/team-hints.perl fiji/fiji:bin/team-hints.perl])
# '''GitHub issue reporting plugin.''' The Fiji BugZilla is temporarily offline; those pages need to be restored, and then—along with the remainder of the [http://trac.imagej.net/ ImageJ Trac]—migrated to GitHub Issues. The [[Report a Bug]] plugin needs to send reports to GitHub instead. ([https://github.com/scijava/scijava-plugins-issues-github scijava/scijava-plugins-issues-github])
# '''SCIFIO blockization.''' ([https://github.com/scifio/scifio/issues/283 scifio/scifio#283])
# '''SciJava Common 3.''' ([https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/compare/sjc3 scijava/scijava-common@sjc3])
# '''ImageJ Launcher.''' Switch to a JavaFX-based native launcher. Retire the current ImageJ Launcher. ([https://github.com/imagej/imagej-launcher/issues/33 imagej/imagej-launcher#33])

I am fully committed to all of the above projects. They are driven by me, making progress only when I directly work on them.

=== Additional projects ===

I am also coordinating and/or leading and/or advising and/or helping with, but not directly implementing, the following additional projects:

# (with {{Person|Awalter2}}) '''ImgLib2 ROIs.''' Development of data structures, especially for use with ImageJ-OMERO. ([http://forum.imagej.net/t/implementation-plan-for-imglib2-rois-2d/2531 Implementation plan for Imglib2-rois 2D])
# (with {{Person|Leon}}) '''RESTful image server.''' Backed by ImageJ. ([https://github.com/imagej/imagej-server imagej/imagej-server])
# (with {{Person|Gab1one}}) '''SciJava I/O.''' ([https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/compare/more-handles scijava/scijava-common@more-handles])
# (with {{Person|Kharrington}}) '''ImageJ in 3D.''' Unification of ImageJ 3D visualization efforts around [[ClearVolume]] and the [[ThreeDViewer]]
# (with {{Person|Pietzsch}}) '''Visualization of big data.''' Unification of visualization in general around the [[BigDataViewer]].

=== Constant priorities ===

Finally, I have the following continuous priorities:

# Mentoring student programmers at [[LOCI]]
# Coordinating programming efforts at [[LOCI]]
# Questions on the [[ImageJ Forum]]
# [[Bugs|Bug reports]]
# [https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+user%3Afiji+user%3Aimagej+user%3Amaven-nar+user%3Ascifio+user%3Ascijava+user%3Aslim-curve&type=Issues Pull requests]
# Email (~300 messages per day as of this writing)
# Server maintenance and troubleshooting
# Project management tasks (e.g., managing [[Issues]])

On average, I spend ~0-2 hours per day on my primary projects above. The rest is spent on these constant priorities.
