== Conventions for algorithm development in ImgLib2 ==

* Algorithms should either implement '''java.lang.Runnable''' if they do not return an object or '''java.util.concurrent.Callable''' if they do

* Multithreading will be solved through the '''ops package''' for easily parallelizable algorithms

* More complicated algorithms that can provide significantly increased performance by implementing their own multithreading scenarios should implement the '''MultiThreading interface''' which allows to adjust the number of threads

* Algorithms will be split into Maven subpackages where each subpackage can manage its own dependencies and licenses
** Gauss
** FFT
** FourierConvolution
** IntegralImg
** ScaleSpace
** ...

* Algorithms will have no direct dependency on the ImageJ2 plugin framework as they are generic; extra classes will provide access to the functionality of those algorithms

* A '''Benchmarker class'' will be implemented to measure the performance on different containers, types, operating systems and machines
