== Conventions for algorithm development in ImgLib2 ==

* Algorithms should either implement '''java.lang.Runnable''' if they do not return an object or '''java.util.concurrent.Callable''' if they do

* Multithreading will be solved through the '''ops package''' for easily parallelizable algorithms

* More complicated algorithms that can provide significantly increased performance by implementing their own multithreading scenarios should implement the '''MultiThreading interface''' which allows to adjust the number of threads

* Algorithms will be split into Maven subpackages where each subpackage can manage its own dependencies and licenses
** [[Gauss ImgLib2 | Gauss]]
** [[FFT ImgLib2 | FFT]]
** [[FourierConvolution ImgLib2 | FourierConvolution]]
** [[IntegralImg ImgLib2 | IntegralImg]]
** [[ScaleSpace ImgLib2 | ScaleSpace]]
** ...

* '''JUnit''' tests should be placed in the respective subpackages and must not require any additional imports

* '''Human tests''' that might display images, show graphs or require any other imports than the algorithm itself should be placed in the '''ImgLib2-Tests''' project following the path convention of the algorithm

* Algorithms will have no direct dependency on the ImageJ2 plugin framework as they are generic; extra classes will provide access to the functionality of those algorithms

* A '''Benchmarker class''' will be implemented to measure the performance for different ''containers'', ''types'', ''operating systems'' and ''machines''
