(Return to the main [[Simple Neurite Tracer]] page)

If you are tracing bright neurons with a structure that appears clear when viewed in a Maximum Intensity Projection of the stack, you can now use a couple of new features of Simple Neurite Tracer to speed up your tracing.  These are:

* The menu option "Show MIP overlays at 20% opacity".  This overlays the Maximum Intensity Projection over the slice views of your data, regardless of which your current slice is.
* The key shortcut 'm', while your mouse is over a point in the image, is the same as a left mouse click at the point of maximum intensity under that point throughout the whole stack.

These features are demonstrated in the following screencast:
