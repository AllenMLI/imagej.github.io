Since we do not have time to monitor the Wiki closely, and rather want to spend that time to enhance the Wiki instead.  For this reason, we have a simple policy: to get an account, you have to ask personally someone who already has an account, and who then should click [{{SERVER}}/wiki/index.php?title=Special:Userlogin&type=signup this link] to create an account for you.
