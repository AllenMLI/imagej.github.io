= Getting help regarding Fiji =

You might want to subscribe to the [http://groups.google.com/group/fiji-users Fiji users'] (or [http://groups.google.com/group/fiji-devel Fiji developers']) mailing list, or just browse the archives for help.

Alternatively, you might want to look in [[IRC]] for other users and developers of Fiji.

For video tutorials, please see our [http://youtube.com/fijichannel YouTube channel].

If you encounter a bug, please consider taking some time to [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/bugzilla/ report a bug via web] (a simple version is available in Fiji itself, in ''Help>Report a Bug'') and test our fixes.  Remember: Fiji is a community effort, and it will be as good as you make it.

= Getting help regarding the Fiji Wiki =

If you look for help editing this Wiki, please look [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Contents here].

A few tips:

* to be able to edit a page, you need to log in. If you do not have a Fiji Wiki account yet, [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/wiki/index.php?title=Special:Userlogin&type=signup ask an existing user to create one for you] (there is an option to do that by sending an email to you).
* to edit a new page, just enter the title in the search box; there will be a red link you can follow to edit the page.
* there are keyboard shortcuts available for ''Preview'' (Alt+P), ''Cancel'' (Alt+C) and ''Save Page'' (Alt+S). You can also jump between the main text and the summary with Tab and Shift+Tab. '''Note:''' the shortcut for ''Show Changes'' is Alt+V (<u>not</u> C!).
* With Safari on MacOSX, the shortcuts are available through Ctrl+Alt+<key>
* if you see a page having a layout you want to imitate, pretend to edit that page, copy the respective markup code (you can cancel editing after you copied it), and paste it into the page where you want to have it.
* there are shortcuts for a few menu items, such as ''Recent Changes'' (Alt+R) or the ''Main Page'' (Alt-Z).

= New accounts =

The Fiji team does not have time to monitor the Wiki closely, and rather wants to spend that time to enhance Fiji and this Wiki instead.

For this reason, we have a simple policy: to get an account, you need to ask personally someone who already has an account, and who then should click [{{SERVER}}/wiki/index.php?title=Special:Userlogin&type=signup this link] to create an account for you. That someone should use your surname as login, put in your full name, add a bogus password, repeat that bogus password and then click the ''by email'' button.
