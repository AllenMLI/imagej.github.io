= Getting help regarding the ImageJ Wiki =

If you look for help editing this Wiki, please look [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Contents here].

== Tips ==

* To be able to edit a page, you need to log in. If you do not have an ImageJ Wiki account yet, [{{SERVER}}/wiki/index.php?title=Special:Userlogin&type=signup register via email].
* To edit a new page, enter the title in the search box; there will be a red link you can follow to edit the page.
* If you see a page having a layout you want to imitate, pretend to edit that page, copy the respective markup code (cancel editing after you copied it), and paste it into the page where you want to have it.
