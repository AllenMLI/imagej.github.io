= Getting help regarding Fiji =

You might want to subscribe to the [http://groups.google.com/group/fiji-users Fiji users'] (or [http://groups.google.com/group/fiji-devel Fiji developers']) mailing list, or just browse the archives for help.

Alternatively, you might want to look in [[IRC]] for other users and developers of Fiji.

For video tutorials, please see our [http://youtube.com/fijichannel YouTube channel].

If you encounter a bug, please consider taking some time to [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/bugzilla/ report a bug via web] (a simple version is available in Fiji itself, in ''Help>Report a Bug'') and test our fixes.  Remember: Fiji is a community effort, and it will be as good as you make it.

= Getting help regarding the Fiji Wiki =

If you look for help editing this Wiki, please look [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Contents here].

= New accounts =

The Fiji team does not have time to monitor the Wiki closely, and rather wants to spend that time to enhance Fiji and this Wiki instead.  For this reason, we have a simple policy: to get an account, you need to ask personally someone who already has an account, and who then should click [{{SERVER}}/wiki/index.php?title=Special:Userlogin&type=signup this link] to create an account for you.
