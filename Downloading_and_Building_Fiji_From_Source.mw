== Downloading the Source Code with Git ==

''Warning: the source code for Fiji is rather large; make sure that you have two gigabytes of disk space free before beginning this.''

To fetch the Fiji source code you should use [http://git.or.cz/ git] (Windows users, please go [http://msysgit.googlecode.com here]).  If you are not familiar with Git, you might want to read [[Git mini howto|this page]] or [[:Category:Git|these pages]] instead.

==== Cloning source as unknown contributor ====
Your first step should be to "clone" the fiji repository with the following command:

 git clone git://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/fiji.git

This should start downloading the base fiji repository and unpack it into a directory called "fiji" in your current directory.  Once this has successfully completed, change into the newly created "fiji" directory.

==== Cloning source as known contributor ====
The above command creates a unknown contributor copy of Fiji in your computer. If you have your own user account in pacific.mpi-cbg.de, then you should clone fiji with the following command:
 
 git clone ''username''@pacific.mpi-cbg.de:/srv/git/fiji.git

Just substitute ''username'' with your corresponding user name on that machine.

=== Submodules ===

Some plugins are managed as submodules.  If you want to work on them, you will have to initialize and update them.  (For more on submodules, see the [[Git submodule tutorial]].)  These submodules must be initialized and updated with the following commands:

 git submodule init ImageJA TrakEM2 VIB micromanager1.1 mpicbg
 git submodule update

The build system will attempt to use the system Java installation if it is available.  However, on some platforms this may not work (or you may not have a recent enough Java installation) so we recommend that you also initialize and update the appropriate Java submodule for your system.  To do this, run one of these commands:

 git submodule init java/linux          # For 32-bit Linux systems
 git submodule init java/linux-amd64    # For 64-bit Linux systems
 git submodule init java/macosx-java3d  # For MacOS X systems
 git submodule init java/win32          # For 32-bit Windows systems
 git submodule init java/win64          # For 64-bit Windows systems

Then update the submodules again with:

 git submodule update java/<the-name-for-your-OS>


Note: using <b>git submodule update</b> without specifying which submodule, will update <b>all</b> submodules. What <i>update</i> means: "put all submodules, if checked out, to the last commit that was committed in the fiji repos". Which is most likely not what you want--will put any submodule that you have been working on into a <b>(no branch)</b> situation. To fix it, just cd to that submodule <i>git checkout master</i> or whatever branch you were working on.

=== Getting a snapshot without Git ===

If you insist on not using Git, you can download a snapshot of Fiji [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=fiji.git;a=snapshot;h=master;sf=tgz here], but you need to make sure that you have a new enough Java version installed.

== Building Fiji from Source==

You should now be able to build Fiji with:

 sh Build.sh run

... which will invoke Fiji's multi-platform build system.  If all goes well, after some time you should see the main Fiji window:
