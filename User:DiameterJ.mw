}}'''DiameterJ''' is a free, open source plugin created for ImageJ, ImageJ 2.X, and FIJI.   DiameterJ is a validated nano- or microfiber characterization tool.  DiameterJ is able to analyze an image and find the diameter of nano- or microfibers at every pixel along a fiber and produces a histogram of these diameters.  Included with this histogram are summary statistics such as mean fiber diameter and most occurring fiber diameter (mode).   DiameterJ also bundles [http://bigwww.epfl.ch/demo/orientation/ OrientationJ] for a complete analysis of fiber orientation within an image as well as the "Analyze Particles" function built into ImageJ/FIJI to analyze pore space within scaffolds and produce summary statistics for pores.  

__TOC__

=== Overview ===
DiameterJ is a two step process of image analysis:

# Image Segmentation into a binary image (black and white pixels only)
# Analysis of Segmented image

14 default segmentation algorithms have been included with '''DiameterJ''' in the "Segment SRM" and "Segment Mixed" plugins.  However, these algorithms may not work for all SEM images.  If the user is not happy with the results of the segmentation algorithms (i.e. the black and white images do not produce an accurate representation of original image) then DiameterJ will still work with any binary image that has been segmented through some other means.  

DiameterJ has been validated with over 130 digital images created ''in silico'' and with scanning electron microscope images of reference wires with known diameters.  To see the full publication that details how DiameterJ was validated and how it works please go to [Coming Soon].

Currently we are working on a native JAVA application on DiameterJ.  This will not fundamentally change the function of DiameterJ however, it will make it faster, look cleaner, and should solve continuity issues
