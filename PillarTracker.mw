The plugin can be automatically downloaded and installed by Fiji's updater.For more details about how to setup the Fiji in a most convenient way, please refer to our documentation here. However, if user doesn't want to use the updater for some reason, one can still download it from following link, and then install it manually.

'''Update History:'''

version '''1.1.3'''
 (1).use pillar reconstruction algorithm to establish exact grid.

 (2).sub-pixel centered kernel when extracting pillar profile.

 (3).compute drift and stabilize the image in frequency domain. 


version '''1.1.2'''

 (2).faster save data into binary files.

 (3).hunt contractile unit(CU).

 (4).save settings into drift binary file.


version '''1.1.0'''
 (1).performance improved. GPU acceleration for image cross correlation with kernel.

 (2).minor bugs are fixed.


version '''1.0.9'''
 (1).support BCC arranged pillar, which has 60 degree of grid angle. 

 (2).support fast localization algorithm: center of mass(CM).
