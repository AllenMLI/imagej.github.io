== Introduction ==

There is an increasing demand to image large biological specimen at high resolution. Typically those specimen do not fit in the field of view of the microscope. To overcome this drawback, motorized stages moving the sample are used to create a tiled scan of the whole specimen. The physical coordinates provided by the microscope stage are not precise enough to allow reconstruction (”Stitching”) of the whole image from individual image stacks.

The 2D/3D Stitching Plugin is able to reconstruct big images/stacks from an arbitrary number of tiled input images/stacks, making use of the Fourier Shift Theorem that computes all possible translations (x, y[, z]) between two 2D/3D images at once, yielding the best overlap in terms of the cross correlation measure. If more than two input images/stacks are used the correct placement of all tiles is determined using a global optimization. To remove brightness differences at the tile borders, a linear intensity blending is applied.

== The Stitching Plugins ==

The Stitching package comes with 4 different plugins:

* '''2D Stitching''': Stitch two 2-dimensional images, rectangular ROIs can be used to limit the area to search in.
* '''3D Stitching''': Stitch two image stacks (3D), rectangular ROIs can be used to limit the area to search in as well.
* '''Stitch Grid of Images''': Stitch an arbitrary number of 2D or 3D images which are arranged in a regular grid (e.g. 4 x 3 images with roughly 10% overlap)
* '''Stitch Collection of Images''': Stitch an arbitrary number of 2D or 3D images which do not have to be in a regular grid. The rough initial configuration (which image is overlapping another one) is given in tile configuration file.
