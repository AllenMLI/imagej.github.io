== '''Overview''' ==
This tool reads FEI SEM acquistion metadata from tiff tags and set image scale based on pixel size. 

Note: This macro use Bio-formats plugin to read metadata. FIJI should include the plugin in default. Otherwise, install Bio-formats manually in ImageJ. 


== '''How to use''' ==

1. Open a “.tif” file acquired from a FEI SEM/FIB (currently acquired by Thermofisher), and make the image window active. Note that the image dimensions are not calibrated.
