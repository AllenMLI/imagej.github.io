THIS IS A DRAFT WHERE SNIPPETS ARE LEFT



=== Calculating linking costs ===


# The distance between the two spots D is calculated 
# If the spots are separated by more than the max distance, the link is forbidden. If not, 
# For each feature in the map, a penalty p is calculated as 

<math> p = 3 \times W \times \frac{ | f_1-f_2|}{f_1+f_2} </math>

where W is the factor associated to the feature in the map. This expression is such that: 
there is no penalty if the 2 feature values f1 and f2 are the same; 
that, with a factor of 1, the penalty if 1 is one value is the double of the other; 
the penalty is 2 if one is 5 times the other one. 
All penalties are summed, to form P = (1 + ∑ p ) 
The cost is set to the square of the product: C = ( D × P )²
