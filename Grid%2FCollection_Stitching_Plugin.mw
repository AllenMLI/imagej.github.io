= What is Grid/Collection Stitching? =
When a large biological specimen must be pictured in high resolution, it must be done in tiles as the entire thing could not fit into the field view of the microscope. Once the entire specimen has been imaged, the tiles must be fit or stitched together to form one coherent image. Some overlap will be present between each tile and its neighbors to verify its location in the image.

The Grid/Collection stitching plugin allows several tiles placed in varying dimensions to be stitched together. 

To learn more about Stitching, please read the [[Stitching]] section of Fiji's [[Cookbook]]. 


= How to use Grid/Collection Stitching =
*Launch the stitching plugin from the menu item Plugins -> Stitching -> Grid/Collection stitching
**Launch the stitching plugin from the menu item Plugins -> Stitching -> Grid/Collection stitching
*In the plugin's graphical user interface (GUI), choose the position type as Positions from file from the first dropbox menu. Then choose the order as Defined by image metadata. With this choice, the images within your file do not need to be in any particular order. Click ok. 
*When a second GUI appears, select a file from your dataset. 
**If Prairie was used for data collection, ensure that the file selected is a .xml or .cfg
*Select a fusion method.
**Linear blending will obscure the seams between tiles, but will take a longer amount of time. Without it, tile lines will be clearly seen if the image is to be blown up. To save time, only use linear blending for presentation pieces. 
*if Prairie or Wiscan are used, uncheck “compute overlap.” Both softwares calculate fairly accurate coordinates beforehand. 
*Reduce “Increase overlap” to 0 and uncheck subpixel accuracy
*If the data computed is too large for computer memory, check “use virtual memory.” This will be considerably slower, but will save RAM
**Alternatively, more memory can be allocated to the FIJI operation 
*Click ok and the images will begin to be stitched together.
