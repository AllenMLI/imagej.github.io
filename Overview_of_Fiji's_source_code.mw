This page will give you an idea how Fiji's source code is organized.  Every directory referred to is relative to the Fiji root, i.e. the directory into which you [[Git mini howto#Cloning|cloned fiji.git]].

== The Fiji launcher ==

The [[Developing Fiji#The_Fiji_launcher|Fiji launcher]] is a relatively small C++ program whose source sits in [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=fiji.git;a=blob;f=fiji.cxx;hb=HEAD <Fiji-root>/fiji.cxx].

The whole purpose of the launcher is to make launching Java and Fiji easier, but there are a few other niceties in there, such as running Jython scripts or .jar files with the same classpath as Fiji.

The generated launcher is ''<Fiji-root>/fiji'' (or on Windows, ''fiji.exe'').

== The plugins ==

We try to [[Why Closed-Source Is Wrong|avoid]] plugins without sources, but even those are not tracked in <Fiji-root>/plugins/, but rather in [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=fiji.git;a=tree;f=staged-plugins;hb=HEAD <Fiji-root>/staged-plugins].  The reason is that we would want to provide our very own ''plugins.config'' files with them, i.e. we want to have custom locations/names of the plugins contained in the ''.jar'' file.

Such ''plugins.config'' files that are to be inserted in certain ''.jar'' also live in ''staged-plugins'', as ''<basename-of-jar>.config''.  Example: the plugins.config for ''loci_tools.jar'' is stored in [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=fiji.git;a=blob;f=staged-plugins/loci_tools.config;hb=HEAD <Fiji-root>/staged-plugins/loci_tools.config].

The sources for many plugins shipped with (and maintained in) Fiji live in [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=fiji.git;a=tree;f=src-plugins;hb=HEAD <Fiji-root>/src-plugins].  The subdirectories in ''src-plugins'' mostly correspond to the basename of the .jar file generated from it.  Example: the sources of ''plugins/Fiji_Updater.jar'' are stored in [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=fiji.git;a=tree;f=src-plugins/Fiji_Updater;hb=HEAD <Fiji-root>/src-plugins/Fiji_Updater/].

== Libraries ==

Some plugins require third-party libraries such as ''Jama''.  Such libraries are not stored in ''plugins/'' (lest an underscore in their filenames would make ImageJ mistake them for plugins), but in ''jars/'' instead.

Some of the libraries' sources are stored in ''src-plugins/'' (in subdirectories corresponding to the basename of the respective ''.jar'' file).

== Submodules ==

Some components of Fiji are stored in ''submodules'', i.e. in [[Git]] repositories of their own right.  This is the case for [[ImageJA]], many third-party libraries, and some plugins collections that existed before Fiji, such as [[TrakEM2]] or [[Bio-Formats]].

These submodules are subdirectories in [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=fiji.git;a=tree;f=modules;hb=HEAD <Fiji-root>/modules/], and they may, or may not, be checked out.

Every submodule is "committed" at a certain revision, i.e. Git not only records where, say, ImageJA is to be cloned from, but also what revision is current for any given commit in ''fiji.git''.

If submodules are checked out, you can cd into the respective directories and work with them as with other Git repositories.

Our policy, however, is that you do not need to check out the submodules if you do not want to work <u>on</u> them: the result of the most recently committed revision needs to be committed as binary in [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=fiji.git;a=tree;f=precompiled;hb=HEAD <Fiji-root>/precompiled/].  For example, the ''.jar'' file generated from the ''bio-formats'' submodule is committed as ''precompiled/loci_tools.jar''.

== The Fiji Build system ==

For historical reasons, the Fiji Build system's source code lives in ''<Fiji-root>/fake/Fake.java''.  It will be compiled into ''<Fiji-root>/fake.jar''.

To avoid a chicken-and-egg problem, a ''fake.jar'' that can compile the current Fiji Build system is committed to ''precompiled/'' (and for the same reason, precompiled versions of the Fiji launchers for all supported platforms live there, too).

== The ''precompiled/'' directory ==

Precompiled versions of all ''.jar'' files generated from submodules, of ''fake.jar'' and of the Fiji launchers live in ''precompiled/''.

== The ''bin/'' directory ==

Quite a few tasks -- such as committing a new submodule or sources for a plugin, or releasing a new version of Fiji -- are performed by scripts.  These scripts live in the ''<Fiji-root>/bin/'' subdirectory.

Some of these scripts are shell scripts, others are Jython scripts with special [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix) shebang] lines which trigger them to be called with the current Fiji launcher.

== The ''nightly-build/'' directory ==

We have a ''cronjob'' that builds Fiji every night, from then-current sources.  The responsible script is ''bin/nightly-build.sh''.

Of course, it might often be quite handy to do the same locally, i.e. compile from a completely pristine state (e.g. to ensure that your latest commit includes all necessary files).  You can easily do that by calling ''./bin/nightly-build.sh HEAD'', which will automatically create an appropriate ''nightly-build/'' subdirectory (if it does not exist yet), and simulate a from-scratch build.
