{{Windows | '''Avoid permissions issues.''' We recommend installing Eclipse ''outside'' of the <code>Program Files</code> directory. E.g.: '''<code>C:\Users\frood\Programs\eclipse</code>''', where '''<code>C:\Users\frood</code>''' is your user directory.

'''Configuring Eclipse.''' After installing Eclipse, you will need to configure it to know about your JDK.

Use Wordpad to edit the <code>eclipse.ini</code> file in your Eclipse installation (e.g., '''<code>C:\Users\frood\Programs\eclipse</code>'''). (Do not use Notepad, because it will not handle the Unix-style line breaks properly.) Carefully follow [http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse.ini#Specifying_the_JVM these instructions] to specify the proper JDK. Then save the file and quit Wordpad.

Now update Eclipse's JRE to be JDK-aware:

* Launch Eclipse
* From the menu choose Window {{arrow}} Preferences
* Select Java {{arrow}} Installed JREs
* Click Search..., navigate to your JDK installation folder (e.g., '''<code>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_11</code>''') and click OK
* Check the box next to the JRE that appears and click OK

{{Linux | '''Avoid permissions issues.''' We recommend installing to <code>$HOME/eclipse</code>.

'''Do not use a package manager.''' For several reasons, we do not recommend installing Eclipse from a package manager. You may not get a new enough version of Eclipse (we recommend 4.3+), you will not get the Java Developers version that includes the M2E plugins, and you will likely have trouble installing additional plugins due to the permissions issues with the system-wide installation.

This article explains how to install and configure Eclipse for use with [[ImageJ]] development. Directions correspond to Eclipse 4.4 Luna, and may need adjustment for other versions.
__TOC__

== Install and configure Eclipse ==

=== Install the Java Development Kit ===

* Download and install the Java Development Kit (JDK) from the [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/ Java web site].

=== Install Eclipse ===

* Download "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" from the [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ Eclipse web site].
{{Warning |  It is '''important''' to choose "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" because it contains Maven support built-in. Otherwise, you will have to [http://eclipse.org/m2e/ install the M2E plugin manually].}}

* Unpack the archive to a location of your choice.

* See the right-hand sidebars for platform-specific notes.

== Clone the source code ==

* Using your [http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis Git client of choice], clone the [[source code]] which interests you.

== Import the source code ==

# Choose File {{arrow}} Import from the Eclipse menu
# Select "Existing Maven Projects" and click Next
# Browse to the folder where you cloned the project source code
# Click Finish

== Launching ImageJ ==

If you cloned the [https://github.com/imagej/imagej imagej project], you can launch the program as follows:

# In the Package Explorer, expand the <code>imagej</code> project
# Navigate into <code>src/main/java</code>
# Navigate into <code>net.imagej</code>
# Right-click on <code>Main.java</code>
