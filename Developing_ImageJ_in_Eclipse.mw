This article explains how to install and configure Eclipse for use with [[ImageJ]] development. Directions correspond to Eclipse 4.3 Kepler, and may need adjustment for other versions.

== Install and configure Eclipse ==

=== Setting up Eclipse on Windows ===

==== Install Java Development Kit ====
 
Download and install JDK 6 from the [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/ Java web site].

Take note of where the Java installation ended up; for the remainder of this guide we will use "'''C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_20'''" though your path is likely to be different.

==== Install Eclipse ====
 
Download "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" from the [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ Eclipse web site]. It is important to choose "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" because it contains Maven support built-in.
 
Unpack the ZIP file to a location of your choice. On Windows 7, to avoid permissions issues, we recommend using your personal Programs folder. Take note of this path; for the remainder of this guide we will use "'''C:\Users\you\Programs\eclipse'''" though your path is likely to be different.
  
==== Configure Eclipse ====

Next, use Wordpad to edit the <code>eclipse.ini</code> file in '''C:\Users\you\Programs\eclipse'''. (Do not use Notepad, because it will not handle the Unix-style line breaks properly.) Carefully follow [http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse.ini#Specifying_the_JVM these instructions] to specify the proper JDK. Then save the file and quit Wordpad.

Now update Eclipse's JRE to be JDK-aware:

* Launch Eclipse
* From the menu choose Window &gt; Preferences
* Select Java &gt; Installed JREs
* Click Search..., navigate to "'''C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_20'''" and click OK
* Check the box next to the JRE that appears and click OK

=== Setting up Eclipse on Mac OS X ===

==== Install Eclipse ====

Download and install "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" from the [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ Eclipse web site]. It is important to choose "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" because it contains Maven support built-in.

=== Setting up Eclipse on Linux ===

==== Install Eclipse ==== 

Download "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" from the [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ Eclipse web site]. It is important to choose "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" because it contains Maven support built-in.

Unpack the tarball to a location of your choice. To avoid
permissions issues, we recommend using a folder in your home directory such as ~/eclipse.

{{Warning
| message = Note: For several reasons, we do not recommend installing Eclipse from a package manager. You may not get a new enough version of Eclipse (we recommend 4.3+), you will not get the Java Developers version that includes the m2e plugins, and you will likely have trouble installing additional plugins due to the permissions issues with the system-wide installation.

== Clone the ImageJ source ==

Using your [http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis Git client of choice], clone the [[Source Code|ImageJ source code]].

== Import the ImageJ source ==

# Choose File &gt; Import from the Eclipse menu
# Select "Existing Maven Projects" and click Next
# Browse to the folder where you cloned the ImageJ source code
# Click Finish
