{{Development | source}}This article explains how to install, configure and use Eclipse to develop [[ImageJ]] [[components]] and [[plugins]]. Directions correspond to Eclipse 4.4 Luna, and may need adjustment for other versions.
__TOC__
= Initial setup =

== Install the Java Development Kit ==

* Download and install the Java Development Kit (JDK) from the [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/ Java web site].

== Install and configure Eclipse ==

=== Install Eclipse ===

* Download "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" from the [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ Eclipse web site].
{{Warning |  It is '''important''' to choose "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" because it contains Maven support built-in. Otherwise, you will have to [http://eclipse.org/m2e/ install the M2E plugin manually].}}

* Unpack the archive to a location of your choice.

=== Configure Eclipse for your platform ===

<table style="width: 99%"><tr><td style="vertical-align: top; width: 33%">
{{ExpandingBox
| [[File:Win.png | x32px]] '''Windows'''
| '''Avoid permissions issues.''' We recommend installing Eclipse ''outside'' of the <code>Program Files</code> directory. E.g.: '''<code>C:\Users\frood\Programs\eclipse</code>''', where '''<code>C:\Users\frood</code>''' is your user directory.

'''Configure Eclipse.''' After installing Eclipse, you will need to configure it to know about your JDK.

Use Wordpad to edit the <code>eclipse.ini</code> file in your Eclipse installation (e.g., '''<code>C:\Users\frood\Programs\eclipse</code>'''). (Do not use Notepad, because it will not handle the Unix-style line breaks properly.) Carefully follow [http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse.ini#Specifying_the_JVM these instructions] to specify the proper JDK. Then save the file and quit Wordpad.

Now update Eclipse's JRE to be JDK-aware:

* Launch Eclipse
* From the menu choose {{bc | Window | Preferences}}
* Select {{bc | Java | Installed JREs}}
* Click Search..., navigate to your JDK installation folder (e.g., '''<code>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_11</code>''') and click OK
* Check the box next to the JRE that appears and click OK

{{ExpandingBox

| '''Avoid permissions issues.''' We recommend installing to <code>$HOME/eclipse</code>.

'''Do not use a package manager.''' For several reasons, we do not recommend installing Eclipse from a package manager. You may not get a new enough version of Eclipse (we recommend 4.3+), you will not get the Java Developers version that includes the M2E plugins, and you will likely have trouble installing additional plugins due to the permissions issues with the system-wide installation.

== Clone the source code ==

* Using your [http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis Git client of choice], clone the [[source code]] which interests you.

== Import the source code ==

# Choose {{bc | File | Import}} from the Eclipse menu
# Select "Existing Maven Projects" and click Next
# Browse to the folder where you cloned the project source code
# Click Finish

Eclipse will import and automatically build the project(s). There should not be any build errors, but it is normal to see a large number (often hundreds) of warnings. These mostly come from Java-1.4-style code or unnecessary imports, variables or methods in the sources of authors who do not use an IDE and thus have no automatic assistance at cleaning up. All these warnings can be ignored, having no effect on the functionality of the code.

Now that you have the project successfully nestled within Eclipse, you can run it, change the code, and run it again, iterating as needed to develop features and fix bugs. This process is known as the ''run-debug cycle''—although some people call it ''compile-debug'' or ''edit-compile-debug'' or ''edit-compile-run'' or ''debug-edit-compile'' or ''edit-build-test-debug'' or ''edit-compile-link-debug'' or...

== Launch ImageJ ==

If you cloned the [https://github.com/imagej/imagej imagej project], you can launch the program as follows:

# In the Package Explorer, expand the <code>imagej</code> project
# Navigate into <code>src/main/java</code>
# Navigate into <code>net.imagej</code>
# Right-click on <code>Main.java</code>
# Choose "Run As" and then "Java Application"

Other projects will have different main classes, but the general procedure is the same.

==Running and debugging==
One major problem when debugging [[ImageJ 1.x]] plugins is that ImageJ 1.x expects all the plugins' ''.jar'' files to live in a sub-directory ''plugins/'' in the ImageJ root directory. We can trick ImageJ by setting the property ''ij.dir'' to the location of the ''.jar'' file generated by m2e. The [[Fiji]] project provides a convenience class ''fiji.Debug'' in the {{GitHub | org=fiji | repo=fiji-lib | label=fiji-lib}} component which lets you do that without any pain:

<source lang="java">
import fiji.Debug; // requires fiji-lib as a dependency

[...]

public static void main(String[] args) {
    // requires a plugins.config in src/main/resources/ that defines the command name:
    // Plugins, "My shiny new plugin", the.current.PluginClass
    Debug.run("My shiny new plugin", "plugin parameters");
}
</source>

The format of <code>plugin parameters</code> can be determined by using the [[macro recorder]], or just pass <code>null</code> if your plugin opens a dialog. For more complex plugins that are not macro recordable, you can pass empty strings to the <code>run</code> method—it will still launch an ImageJ instance with your plugin on the classpath.

If your plugin does not depend on <code>fiji-lib</code> by default, you can add it using [https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html maven]. Just paste the following block into your <code>pom.xml</code> dependencies:

<source lang="xml">
<dependency>
    <groupId>sc.fiji</groupId>
    <artifactId>fiji-lib</artifactId>
</dependency>
</source>

To debug classes of type ''PlugInFilter'', use the ''Debug.runFilter(imagePath, plugin, parameters)'' method instead.

Note: if you do not even require ImageJ 1.x to really know about your plugin (i.e. the plugin does not have to show up in the menus for the testing/debugging to work), you can also do something like this instead:

<source lang="java">
public static void main(String[] args) {
    new ImageJ();
    ImagePlus image = IJ.openImage("/path/to/fiji/samples/clown.jpg");
    IJ.runPlugIn(image, "fiji.My_Beautiful_Plugin", "parameter=Hello");
    image.show();
    WindowManager.addWindow(image.getWindow());
}
</source>

==Testing your plugin in an existing installation==

When you run your plugin from Eclipse, you're only testing with the classpath ''of this project''—which may or may not reflect the environment of an actual user's installation. To test your plugin in an existing installation you can either simply copy the jar, or use Maven to install your plugin and its dependencies.
[[File:MavenRunConfig.png|thumb|right|450px|Setting up a new Maven Build configuration]]
===Option 1: Copying the jar===

All modern Eclipse installations have the m2e plugin, so you can simply tell Maven to [http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseMaven/article.html#example_eclipsemavenproject_runningthebuild build the project]. This creates a <code>.jar</code> in the <code>/target</code> subdirectory, which you can then copy to an <code>ImageJ.app/jars/</code> directory.

This is a simple option that makes minimal changes to the existing installation.

===Option 2: Install dependencies===

All mavenized ImageJ projects have built-in support for installing directly into an existing installation, overwriting previous versions of any components, and pulling in up-to-date versions of any dependencies. This is the most robust way to test your plugin, but note that it may make additional changes to your existing ImageJ installation.

Steps are as follows:
# Right-click your project in Eclipse and select {{bc|Run As|Run Configurations...}}
# Scroll down to Maven Build. If you've built this project with Maven via Eclipse before there will already be a configuration for it. Otherwise you can double-click "Maven Build" to create a new run configuration.
# Add a parameter: <code>imagej.app.directory</code> with value: <code><path/to/ImageJ.app></code> (e.g. <code>/home/hinerm/Fiji.app</code>)
# Add a parameter: <code>delete.other.versions</code> with value: <code>true</code>
# Click <code>Apply</code>

You can now run the project from this dialog. You only need to perform this configuration once though—future uses of the [http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseMaven/article.html#example_eclipsemavenproject_runningthebuild Maven Build] option will automatically copy your plugin and its dependencies to the specified ImageJ app.

==Adding new plugins==

The easiest method is to start with a [https://github.com/imagej/minimal-ij1-plugin/zipball/master minimal project], renamed to the desired name of your plugin. By convention, the project directory should match the base name of the <code>.jar</code> file to be generated.

The format of such a <code>pom.xml</code> is described briefly on the [[Maven]] page.

Most importantly, you will need to adjust the <code>artifactId</code> and the <code>dependencies</code> section. Should you require a dependency that is not used in Fiji yet, you might want to search for the appropriate <code>groupId</code> and <code>version</code> in the [http://maven.imagej.net/ ImageJ Maven repository].

Next, you will put your Java sources into <code>src/main/java/</code> and adjust <code>src/main/resources/plugins.config</code>.

After that, ask Eclipse to import it: {{bc | File | Import | Maven | Import Existing Maven Project}}.
