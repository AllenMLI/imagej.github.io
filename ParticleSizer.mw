== Purpose ==
The ParticleSizer script was developed to automatically measures the distributions of the characteristic size and shape properties of a nanomaterial. In the scope of implementing the European Commission definition of a nanomaterial, the minimal external dimension of the primary particles of a particulate material is assessed as the minimal feret diameter from electron microscopy images. Other size and shape parameters are measured simultaneously.

== Installation ==
The ParticleSizer script combines a number of different plugins. The most easy way is activate Biomedgroup & ParticleSizer update site. 

It is recommended to install R to get better plots. When this point is skipped, a
stripped-down plot will be shown:

# Download the latest R: https://cran.uni-muenster.de/
## Download the Rserver package:
https://rforge.net/bin/windows/contrib/3.0/Rserve_1.8-0.zip
## Download the MASS package:
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/contrib/3.2/MASS_7.3-45.zip
## Start R and select the packages downloaded in 5.2 and 5.3 via "Start Packages -> Install packages from local zip files"
