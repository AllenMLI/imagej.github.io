== Purpose ==
This plugin can be used to estimate nonlinear distortions induced by the image acquisition process. It does not require special calibration samples, but needs sufficient overlapping image areas with preferably high contrast. For further information on how to best arrange calibration images please see the documentation.

== Documentation ==

The documentation of this plugin is in [http://www.kaynig.de/downloads/DistortionCorrectionPlugin_Manual.pdf this pdf.]
