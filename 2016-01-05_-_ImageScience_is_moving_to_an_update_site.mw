Resulting from [https://github.com/imagescience/ImageScience/pull/1 a discussion] with {{Person|ImageScience}}, the [[ImageScience]] plugins have moved to their own dedicated [[update site]], and will no longer be distributed as part of core [[Fiji]].

== What moved? ==

The ImageScience plugins include:

* [[FeatureJ]]
* [[MTrackJ]]
* [[RandomJ]]
* [[TransformJ]]

There is also a fifth plugin, [[NeuronJ]], which is now part of the ImageScience update site, not part of Fiji previously.

== Why? ==

The main reasons for the switch are:

* To give Erik more control over the [[development lifecycle]] ([[versioning]], [[releases]], etc.).
* To avoid a licensing conflict between Fiji's [[GPL]] license and [http://www.imagescience.org/meijering/software/imagescience/ ImageScience's proprietary one].

== How does this affect me? ==

If you are using these plugins in your own workflows ([[scripts]], [[macros]], [[plugins]], etc.), then you will need to [[How to follow a 3rd party update site|enable the ImageScience update site]] for those workflows to remain functional.

We will leave the current versions of the ImageScience plugins on the Fiji update site for a few more weeks, to give people time to transition to the update site. We anticipate a "spring cleaning" announcement in a couple of months, announcing the removal of several plugins, including the ImageScience ones.

As always, thanks for your support, and [[Contact|let us know]] if you have any questions or concerns with this change.
