== Training ==
=== Training on a single image ===
# Start ImageJ / Fiji
# Open a noisy image of your choice (it should be sufficiently large)
# (optional) open another noisy image for validation (judging how well the training is performing) and prediction (it will be denoised automatically after the training is finished)
# Click on <code>Plugins > CSBDeep > N2V > N2V train</code>

== Limitations ==
- single channel only for now
