== Edge and Symmetry filter ==
3D Canny-Deriche edge detection filter and symmetry filter.

== Author ==
Thomas Boudier 

== Description ==
This plugin will compute the gradients of the image based on the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector Canny edge detector]. 
The symmetry filter will vote for the voxels inside the object based on the gradient vector direction. 

'''Alpha parameter''' refers to the smoothing in canny edge detection, the smaller the value, the smoother the edges.

The '''radius''' parameter refer to the radius of the object whose symmetry is to be detected. Normalization and scaling refer to internal values of the algorithm, see Gertych //et al.// for references. The smoothed version is smoothed using ImageJ 3D Gaussian filter with a radius 2. 

The '''improved seed detection''' refer to a modified implementation to better detect seeds inside objects rather than objects themselves.

The gradient vector is perpendicular to the edges, voxels along the direction of the gradient are highlighted and ''vote'' for the symmetry.
