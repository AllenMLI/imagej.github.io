Recall saved calibrations for your microscope's measurement scale and create measurement annotations.

[[Category:Plugins]]
[[Category:Registration]]

== Description ==
This set of plugins provides a quick way to save measurement calibrations for various microscopes/objectives in a simple text file.

You can then choose any of your prior calibrations to be applied to an open image (or all open images), as so:
[[File:Microscope_Meas_Tools_-_Choose_Calibration_01.png]]
  
The "Draw Measurement" plugin then allows you to annotate a line ROI with the calibrated measurement length, as so:
[[File:Microscope_Meas_Tools_-_Draw_Meas_Line.png]]


Three files are included:

* ''Choose_Microscope_Calibration.py''
** Opens the "Choose Calibration" window, for setting the measurement scale to a preconfigured value.
* ''Draw_Measurement_-_Line.py''
** Converts a Line ROI into a drawn annotation with the measurement length indicated.
* ''Microscope_Calibrations_user_settings.py''
** Settings file that contains your pre-configured scale calibrations, along with some settings for drawing annotations (background/text color etc.)

== Installation & Usage Manual ==
Please see the installation & usage instructions here: 
[https://github.com/demisjohn/Microscope-Measurement-Tools/blob/master/Microscope%20Meas.%20-%20Calibration%20instructions.pdf Microscope Meas. - Calibration instructions.pdf]

1. Extract the .zip file linked in GitHub/Releases, and place the resulting ''Analysis'' folder inside
''Fiji.app/Plugins/Scripts''

(If an ''Analysis'' folder already exists, do Not overwrite it - you must have another Analysis plugin installed!  Instead, merge the two folders.

2. Open an image with a feature of some known length, taken with some microscope/objective that you desire to save a calibration for.

3. Draw a line along the feature of known length.

4. Select the ''Analyze > Set Scale'' menu item.

5. Type in the known length in "''Known Distance''", record the "*Scale*" value for this calibration.  Perform more calibrations if needed, recording the Scale values for each.

6. Edit the File 

''Fiji.app / plugins / Scripts / Analyze / Microscope Measurement Tools /
Microscope_Calibrations_user_settings.py''

7. Type in the Calibrations names & Scales for each, making sure to match up the lists with their corresponding calibrations.

Unfortunately, the changes to the settings file may not be automatically picked up by Fiji.
The workaround is to do the following:

8. Quit Fiji.

9. Delete the "''py.class''" file in the pluginâ€™s folder (and edit your user-settings file as needed):

''Fiji.app / plugins / Scripts / Analyze / Microscope Measurement Tools /
Microscope_Calibrations_user_settings$py.class''

10. Open Fiji. It should have picked up the new settings now.

11. Run ''Analyze > Microscope Measurement Tools > Choose Microscope Calibration'' - the pop-up window shows the new names and calibration values you set in your user-settings file.

You should only have to do this calibration once, when you do your initial calibration/setup.

== Author(s) ==
This simple python (jython) plugin was created by [mailto:demis.john@gmail.com Demis D. John], 2015.

I used the following plugins as inspiration: [Correct_3D_drift Correct_3D_drift] and [http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/microscope-scale.html Microscope Scale] (which sadly doesn't work as easily anymore).

Please feel free to add other measurement annotation plugins!
