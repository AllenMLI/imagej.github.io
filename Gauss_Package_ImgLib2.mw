=== Gauss Package for ImgLib2 ===

== Purpose ==

The gauss package for ImgLib2 is an generic, optimized implementation of the traditional Gaussian convolution. It can perform anisotropic, n-dimensional convolution on any image or any interval on an image, if required even in-place. 

The computation is performed multi-threaded and accesses each pixel of the input and output containers only once to guarantee high performance, even on paged cell containers. The precision of the computation can be of any ImgLib2 NumericType, however, there are more efficient implementations for convolution with float and double precision. Any precision of gaussian convolution can be computed on any type of real valued input data, it will be internally wrapped to either float or double. For other conversions (e.g. perform a gaussian convolution on complex float data with complex double precision) respective converters need to be provided. However, any NumericType can always be convolved with its own precision. Warning: this might reduce the accuracy of the computation significantly if the Type itself is an integer type.
