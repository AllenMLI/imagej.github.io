== Balloon Segmentation for multicellular data ==

=== Introduction === 
An plugin that allows the segmentation off cell wall boundaries from microscopy images. This plugin has been developed to extract cell architectures from live imaging datasets. It uses a physical “balloon inflation” algorithm for finding the cell boundaries from 8bits images. Features include:

* Extraction of lists of individual cell shapes
* The determination of the cells being in contact each other
* All previous segmentation steps are automatic, but it is possible to make manual modifications at each step;
* Settings are saved in properties files for different types of images to be segmented
