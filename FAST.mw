== Description ==
FAST: '''F'''luorescence image '''A'''nalysi'''S''' '''T'''ool

This ImageJ macro automates tasks (open, set threshold, save Region Of Interest, measure) to process a set of single-channel fluorescence images.

== Installation ==
ImageJ: requires v1.49o or newer.

Use the ImageJ Updater and follow the instructions to [https://imagej.net/Following_an_update_site add FAST and follow updates] from the available update sites (http://sites.imagej.net/FAST)

New commands should then appear in '{{bc | Plugins | FAST }}'.

=== Step 1: Auto processing of images within the selected work directory ===

# List all files containing user-defined extension (.czi - .zvi - .tif - .nd2) within selected directory and sub-directories.
# Apply the user-defined threshold (default 290) then analyse pixels above the threshold.
# Group pixels above the threshold in one Region Of Interest and save this ROI in a zip file in the image directory.

=== Step 2: User confirmation of selected Regions Of Interest and measure ===

# Open images one by one to check the auto-selected ROI.
# User can confirm the ROI, modify it directly or remove image from further analysis.
# Measure of fluorescence in selected ROI.

== Startup Options ==
[[File:FAST_Options.png|thumb|right|Options dialog box]]
The macro displays a dialog box to set analysis options:

; '''Threshold value''' : set threshold value for pixel intensity, segmenting the image into features of interest (above threshold) and background.
{{Tip | id = Threshold | tip ='''''Threshold value has to be defined for each acquisition system (microscope + camera + exposure time + file-type)'''''.}}

; '''File type''' : select image type between CZI (Carl Zeiss Image), ZVI (Zeiss Vision Image), ND2 (Nikon) or TIFF (Tagged Image File Format).

; '''Create ROIs''' : Step 1, analyses pixels above the user-defined threshold value and automatically saves Regions Of Interest zip file in the image directory.

; '''Measure ROIs''' : Step 2 of image analysis to check individually and measure previously created ROIs. (With Step 1 unchecked and Step 2 checked, user can reanalyse previous data).

; '''Overwrite existing ROIs''' : If selected, the macro will overwrite ROIs zip files without prompting the user every time.

; '''Silent Mode''' : If selected, the macro will measure the ROI of all images without prompting the user every time. Useful for reanalysis of previous data.

; '''Restart Mode''' : When auto processing is cancelled accidentally, this mode checks the last ROI created and restart analysis from this point.

== Validation of selected Regions Of Interest ==
[[File:FAST_ROI-check.png|200px|thumb|right|User validation of defined ROI]]
After completion of Step 1 of image processing, images and their corresponding ROIs need to be validated by the user.

Each image and the corresponding ROI are opened automatically.
An options dialog box is displayed.

* If the area is correct the user must click {{key press|OK}} to proceed with next image.
* If the area contains non-specific signal, select {{key press|Yes}} to ''redefine area manually'' and edit the ROI.
* The dialog box allows to exclude current image from analysis (e.g. blurred image).
Just select the radio button option needed then click {{key press|OK}} or {{key press|⏎ENTER}} to continue.


[[File:FAST_ROI-edition.png|200px|thumb|right|Dialog box to redefine area]]
If you selected to ''redefine area manually'', a new dialog box is displayed to get access to the ImageJ toolbar and modify the selection. The user-defined threshold is then automatically applied.

Select the appropriate tool in ImageJ toolbar: Freehand (default) OR Wand tool.
To remove non-specific fluorescence, use Freehand tool and hold {{key press|Alt}} while selecting area to remove from ROI.
To add area to the previously selected ROI, hold {{key press|Shift}} while selecting new area to add.

Click {{key press|OK}} to validate the new ROI.
Fluorescence is then measured and the zip file is automatically updated.
In case the selection is empty after manual correction the macro discards the image from analysis.

After completion of Step 2, a list of all measured images with filename is displayed in the Result Table window of ImageJ.

This table is automatically saved as a csv file in the work directory selected at startup.
