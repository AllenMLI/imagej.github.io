Simlar to the [[Spirals_(Macro)|spirals]] sample, {{GitHub|repo=fiji|path=plugins/Scripts/File/Open_Samples/Adelsons_Squares.ijm|label=Adelson's squares}} demonstrate that human vision is suboptimal for quantitative measurements.

However, this makes us believe that the two squares with the diamonds have a different background color, yet they are identical!
