Simlar to the [[Spirals_(Macro)|spirals]] sample, {{GitHub|repo=fiji|path=plugins/Scripts/File/Open_Samples/Adelsons_Squares.ijm|label=Adelson's squares}} demonstrate that human vision is suboptimal for quantitative measurements. In the natural context in which humans developed, it makes sense to compensate for shadows. However, this makes us believe that the two squares with the black diamonds have a different shade of grey, yet they are identical in brightness, or RGB values. Since one is part of the whites, and the other the blacks, our brains, knowing the cherckeboard pattern, fools our perception to believe the "white" square is lighter than the "black" square.
