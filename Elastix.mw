== Overview ==


Elastix is a FIJI plugin that wraps [http://elastix.isi.uu.nl/ elastix] into a graphical user interface. elastix is a collection of algorithms that are commonly used to solve image registration problems. Both 2D and 3D as well as multi-channel registrations are supported. Several rigid (translation, Euler, similarity, and affine) as well as locally deformable (BSpline) registrations are supported. For more information please visit the GitHub [https://github.com/embl-cba/fiji-plugin-elastixWrapper#fiji-plugins-for-running-elastix-and-transformix README].

== Installation ==

Elastix is available from the ImageJ update site: http://sites.imagej.net/EMBL-CBA. 

For details on how to install an update site click [[Following_an_update_site|here]].

To use this plugin you also need to install elastix itself, as described [https://github.com/embl-cba/fiji-plugin-elastixWrapper/blob/master/README.md#install-elastix-binary here].

To start Elastix in ImageJ, select Plugins > Registration > Elastix > Elastix from the main menu.
