}}Brian is a consultant who works on image analysis problems. He is a contributor to the [[ImageJ Ops]] project.
== What is Brian working on ==
=== Consulting ===
I consult mainly with startups and small businesses, in the biomed space, who are looking to commercialize academic research.  Often times they have pre-existing matlab and other legacy code that needs to be converted to a user-friendly app, such as an ImageJ-plugin.
