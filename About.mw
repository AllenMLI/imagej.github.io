ImageJ2 is a new version of [http://imagej.net/ ImageJ] for the next generation 
of multidimensional image data, with a focus on scientific imaging. Its central goal is to broaden the paradigm of ImageJ beyond the limitations of ImageJ 1.x, to support the next generation of multidimensional scientific imaging.

To ensure backwards compatibility, ImageJ2 has been designed to fully integrate into the existing ImageJ user interface. This allows users to keep using ImageJ in familiar ways, while providing the ability to migrate toward more powerful new features as needed.

The [[Fiji]] distribution of ImageJ has shipped with beta versions of ImageJ2 for quite some time, so you may already be familiar with some of ImageJ2's featuresâ€”some of which, such as the [[Updater]] and
[[Launcher]], were originally developed as part of Fiji.

== Features of ImageJ2 ==

ImageJ2 provides a wealth of new features and capabilities:

* The ImageJ Updater makes it simple to keep your ImageJ up to date, and to add new plugins by enabling additional [[Update Sites]].
* New and enhanced file format support via the [[SCIFIO]] library ([[#Improved_image_I.2FO_with_the_SCIFIO_library|see below]]).
* More powerful [[Script Editor]] with support for several scripting languages.
* New commands:
** ''Plugins > Debug > Dump Stack'' for debugging when things [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_(computing) hang].
** ''Plugins > Debug > System Information'' for reporting on versions of installed plugins and libraries.
* Use ImageJ2's N-dimensional [[ImgLib2]]-based data structures (still in beta).
* Write parameterized commands and scripts:
** Typed inputs and outputs with no dependence on AWT user interface.
** Mix and match ImageJ 1.x and ImageJ2 data structures.
** Plugins appear in the menu automatically without plugins.config files.
** Reusable in many contexts: KNIME, CellProfiler, OMERO, headless...

== ImageJ2 is more than just an application ==

ImageJ2 is also a collection of reusable software libraries built on the [http://www.scijava.org/ SciJava] software stack, using a powerful plugin framework to facilitate rapid development and painless user customization.

The following software component libraries form the core of ImageJ2:
* [https://github.com/imagej/imagej-common ImageJ Common] - The core image data model, using ImgLib2.
* [https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops ImageJ OPS] - An extensible framework for reusable image processing algorithms.
* [https://github.com/imagej/imagej-updater ImageJ Updater] - A mechanism to update individual plugins and libraries within ImageJ.
* [https://github.com/imagej/imagej-legacy ImageJ Legacy] - Provides complete backwards compatibility with ImageJ 1.x.
* [https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common SciJava Common] - The core frameworks for plugins, modules and the application itself.

== Improved image I/O with the SCIFIO library ==

ImageJ2 uses the [[SCIFIO]] library (SCientific Image Format Input and Output)  by default for most image input tasks. You can change this behavior at any time by running ''Edit > Options > ImageJ2'' and modifying the ''Use SCIFIO when opening files'' option.

For further details, see the [[SCIFIO]] page.
