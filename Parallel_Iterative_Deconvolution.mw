== Purpose ==

Parallel Iterative Deconvolution is an ImageJ plugin for iterative deblurring. This plugin takes advantage of multi-core processors. 

== Documentation ==

The plugin code is based on a [[Matlab]] toolbox: [http://mathcs.emory.edu/%7Enagy/RestoreTools/index.html RestoreTools] by James G. Nagy and several of his students, including Julianne Chung, Katrina Palmer, Lisa Perrone, and Ryan Wright and also on [[Iterative Deconvolve 3D]] by Robert Dougherty.

It implements the 4 following iterative methods:
* MRNSD - Modified Residual Norm Steepest Descent
* WPL - Wiener Filter Preconditioned Landweber
* CGLS - Conjugate Gradient for Least Squares
* HyBR - Hybrid Bidiagonalization Regularization

Please refer to the [http://sites.google.com/site/piotrwendykier/software/deconvolution/paralleliterativedeconvolution website] for details and examples.

* [[Diffraction PSF 3D]] for the creation of theoretical PSF. 
* [[Parallel Spectral Deconvolution]] by the same author, for another set of methods.
