== Purpose ==

Parallel Iterative Deconvolution is an ImageJ plugin for iterative deblurring. This plugin takes advantage of multi-core processors. 

== Documentation ==

The plugin code is based on a [[Matlab]] toolbox: [http://mathcs.emory.edu/%7Enagy/RestoreTools/index.html RestoreTools] by James G. Nagy and several of his students, including Julianne Chung, Katrina Palmer, Lisa Perrone, and Ryan Wright.

It implements the 3 following iterative methods:
* MRNSD - Modified Residual Norm Steepest Descent
* CGLS - Conjugate Gradient for Least Squares
* HyBR - Hybrid Bidiagonalization Regularization

Please refer to the [http://piotr.wendykier.googlepages.com/iterativedeconvolution website] for details and examples.

== See also ==

* [[Diffraction PSF 3D]] for the creation of theoretical PSF. 
* [[Parallel Spectral Deconvolution]] by the same author, for another set of methods.
