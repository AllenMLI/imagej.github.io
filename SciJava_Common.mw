SciJava Common is a common library for [[SciJava]] software. It provides a plugin framework, with an extensible mechanism for service discovery, backed by its own annotation processor, so that plugins can be loaded dynamically. It is used by both [[ImageJ]] and [[SCIFIO]].

See the {{GitHub|org=scijava|repo=scijava-common|label=source repository}} for more information.
