SciJava Common is a common library for SciJava software. It provides a plugin framework, with an extensible mechanism for service discovery, backed by its own annotation processor, so that plugins can be loaded dynamically. It is used by both [[ImageJ]] and [[SCIFIO]].

See the [source repository](https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common) for more information.
