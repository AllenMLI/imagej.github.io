The '''Sprout Morphology''' plugin measures sprout ''number'', ''length'', ''width'' and ''cell density'' of endothelial cell (EC) sprouts grown in a bead sprouting assay. It optionally includes measuring the coverage of these sprouts with pericytes included in the assay, as well as the endothelial cell/pericyte ratio.

== Installation ==

To install the plugin, activate the '''Angiogenesis''' [[How_to_follow_a_3rd_party_update_site|update site]] and restart Fiji.

== Usage ==

Open a maximum intensity projection of the multi-channel image to be analyzed, the start the plugin via {{bc|Analyze|Sprout Morphology}}. The process consists of up to six dialogs:
