==Microtubule polarity and (+) end vs. (-) end tracking ==

Microtubules have an intrinsic polarity with a slow growing (-) and a faster growing (+) end. Usually, (+)
end dynamics are reported and this option allows for (+) end selection. If the first frames do not allow
for unambiguous determination of polarity, the user can use Option 2 to move to a frame where growth is visible. The default setting is that all recognized ends will be tracked over the complete length of the movie. Clicking “Confirm dynamic seeds” will show which seeds are going to be tracked.
