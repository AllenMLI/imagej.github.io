When starting the plugin, pictures and Sync Wins dialog appear, like in the picture above, together with the plugin dialog. The first picture is the input image, the second one is the filtered picture (“Filtered-” prefix), the third one contains the wavelet coefficients (“WT-“ prefix), that are converted to 8-bit and are intensity scaled for good visualization, the fourth picture (“WT-NoStretch-” prefix) contains float values of the wavelet coefficients without intensity scaling. The third and fourth pictures appear only after checking corresponding boxes in the main dialog. Applying Synchronize All in the Sync Wins dialog is helpful when navigating through image stacks.
