The TopoJ plugins help you analyze surfaces of bright objects in image stacks. You can load an example via ''File>Open Samples>SinteredAlumina (2.6MB)'':

To see the surface structure, use ''Plugins>3D Viewer'':

== Compute Topography ==

To computer the Topography, call ''Analyze>TopoJ>Compute Topography'':

For the sample image, a window value of ''5'' is appropriate. The result looks like this:

== Remove Slope ==

To remove the overall slope of the surface, click on the ''Analyze>TopoJ>Remove Slope'' menu item:
