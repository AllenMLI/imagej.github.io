== Purpose ==

This plugin offers hardware-accelerated visualization possibilities for
image stacks. Stacks can be displayed as texture-based volume renderings, 
surfaces or orthoslices.

== Screencasts ==

There is a [[:File:3D_Viewer_2pass_65k.flv|demo screencast (~15 min, 8 MB, FLV format)]] available, showing many of the features of the 3D viewer. It has been transcoded for this wiki to meet the size and codec constraints, the original file is available on the old 3D Viewer website as an [http://132.187.25.13/home/imagej/Viewer.avi AVI (60 MB)]

Beyond this, the [http://132.187.25.13/ij3d/?page=Screencasts&category=Documentation original homepage] provides a lot more screencasts, covering the following topics:

* Display stacks
* Rendering modes and attributes
* Adjusting the transfer functions
* Editing volumes
* Point lists
* Landmark-based registration
* Transformations
* 3D Content in PDFs

== For developers ==

A lot of functions of the 3D Viewer are macro-recordable. However, if that is not enough (or if the function is not recorded properly), it is better to [[Introduction into Developing Plugins|write a plugin]]. In the latter case no macros should be called from Java, as that would limit the code to work with the currently active 3D Viewer (even if the user clicked somewhere else).

This code snippet should get you started:

<source lang="java">
Image3DUniverse univ = new Image3DUniverse();
univ.show();
univ.addMesh(yourImagePlus, null, "somename", 50, new boolean[] {true, true, true}, 2);
...
</source>

Until everything is migrated to this wiki, the original website provides the [http://132.187.25.13/ij3d/?category=Documentation&page=Developer_HowTos full 3D Viewer developer documentation].
