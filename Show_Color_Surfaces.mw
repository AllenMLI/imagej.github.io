This plugin allows you to add surfaces generated from ''label field stacks'' to a new or existing 3D viewer.

A ''label field'' is an 8-bit image stack where the numbers attached to each pixels refer to a specific class rather than an intensity. Usually, label fields are visualized using a lookup table so that different classes are shown as different colors.

The ''Show Color Surfaces'' command calculates surfaces embedded into the [[3D Viewer]] from label fields:
