== Purpose ==

This plugin threshold an image using the Maximum Entropy algorithm, which is similar to [[Otsu Thresholding]] technique. Here, rather than maximizing the inter-class variance (equivalently, minimizing the within-class variance), the inter-class ''entropy'' is maximized. 

== Documentation == 

The plugin requires a 8-bit image to process. It outputs directly the thresholded image, replacing the original one. 

It processes stacks correctly, by operating on the whole stack histogram to determine the threshold. A new, thresholded stack replace the original one.
