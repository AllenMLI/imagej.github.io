__NOTOC__ 
A [[Beanshell_Scripting|BeanShell]] script that retrieves local maxima and minima from an ImageJ plot.


== Description == 
TO BE DONE.

== Installation ==
Download [https://raw.github.com/tferr/Scripts/master/Analysis/Find_Peaks.bsh Find_Peaks.bsh] and place it in the plugins/ folder using the <span style="border-bottom:1px dotted #ccc;">Pluginsâ–· Install...</span> command.

== Usage ==

;Peak amplitude
: TO BE DONE.

;Min. value of maxima
: TO BE DONE.

;Max. value of minima
: TO BE DONE.

;Min. peak distance
:The smallest separation between peaks (in X-axis units). When this value is not zero, smaller peaks that occur within the specified vicinity will be ignored. This works in the following way: 1) Identified peaks that fulfill all criteria above are sorted in descending order; 2) Beginning with the largest peak, the script ignores all remaining peaks that are not separated by more than ''Min. peak distance''.

;Min. peak distance
:TO BE DONE.

;Exclude peaks on edges of plot
:TO BE DONE.
