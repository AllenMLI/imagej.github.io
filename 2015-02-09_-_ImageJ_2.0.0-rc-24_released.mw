== What's new ==

First pass to reduce [[SCIFIO]] overhead:
* Fixed a bug resulting in 2s timeouts when calling SCIFIO from a macro.
* Improved caching of common data (boosts performance throughout ImageJ2).
* SCIFIO configurations use more sensible defaults, favoring performance.
* For some highly unscientific benchmarks of performance, see right.

First wave of improvements from 2015-01 Konstanz [[ImageJ-OPS]] [[hackathon]]
* Better op code generation layer via Groovy parser.
* Better error messages when ops don't match.
* Support for unary & binary arithmetic with primitives.
* New kernel implementations + FFT Ops.

Updated messages for Refresh Menus & related commands to be more user-friendly (hopefully).

== What's next ==

Looking ahead at short-term goals:
* Fixes/improvements for command-line functionality.
* More SCIFIO performance improvements.
* An automated troubleshooter to improve the average user experience.

== How to update ==
