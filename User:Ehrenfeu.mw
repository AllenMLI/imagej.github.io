From Stackoverflow: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3124629/ How to set the System Font for Eclipse (Linux only)]

Create a file, e.g. <code>~/.gtkrc-eclipse</code> with this content:
 style "eclipse" {
     font_name = "Sans Condensed 8"
 }
 class "GtkWidget" style "eclipse"


Then run eclipse using this command:
 GTK2_RC_FILES=~/.gtkrc-eclipse eclipse
