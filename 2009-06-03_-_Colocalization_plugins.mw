By request of Daniel James White, we now have Colocalization plugins in [[Fiji]].  We took two plugins from the [[MBF Plugin Collection]], fixed them to work with newer [[ImageJ]] versions, and put them into the Fiji [[Updater]].  Oh, and of course, they are {{GitLink|jar=Colocalisation_Analysis}}, too.
