By request of Daniel James White, we now have Colocalization plugins in Fiji.  We took two plugins from the [http://www.macbiophotonics.ca/imagej/ MacBiophotonics plugins], fixed them to work with newer ImageJ versions, and put them into the Fiji Updater.  Oh, and of course, they are [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=fiji.git;a=history;f=src-plugins/Colocalisation_Analysis in our source code repository], too.
