== Explanation ==

The [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=6820324 shape index] describes the surface topology of the image interpreted as a [[3D Surface Plot|height field]]:

|+ shape index

| 0.5
| 0.25

| -0.25

| -1
|-
|+ meaning
| cap

| cup
|}

The shape index is calculated from the principal curvatures of the Hessian, which is very susceptible to noise. Therefore the plugin asks you to specify a radius for Gaussian blurring as a preprocessing step.

== Example ==

With radius 2, this results in the following shape index map (bright spots correspond to caps, dark to cups):
