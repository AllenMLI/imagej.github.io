Over the past many months, we have been incrementally working toward support for HTTPS (i.e., secure) web traffic for ImageJ's web-based resources. At the [[2016-12-20 - Fiji + KNIP hackathon|recent hackathon at MPI-CBG]], we largely completed these efforts. Some of the  domains which now fully support HTTPS include:

* https://imagej.net/
* https://downloads.imagej.net/
* https://javadoc.imagej.net/
* https://jenkins.imagej.net/
* https://maven.imagej.net/
* https://mirror.imagej.net/
* https://search.imagej.net/
* https://sites.imagej.net/
* https://status.imagej.net/
* https://update.imagej.net/
* https://wsr.imagej.net/
* https://fiji.sc/
* https://samples.fiji.sc/
* https://update.fiji.sc/

More work is still needed to make the [[ImageJ Updater]] always prefer talking to update sites via HTTPS rather than HTTP; see [http://forum.imagej.net/t/https-to-make-imagej-fiji-more-secure/398 the relevant forum thread] for further details.

This work will make ImageJ and Fiji more secure, preventing potential man-in-the-middle attacks and arbitrary code injection.
