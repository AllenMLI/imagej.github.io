=== Displaying selected views in BigDataViewer ===

If your dataset is in a format suitable for quick visualization by [[BigDataViewer]] (e.g. multiresolution HDF5 or virtually loading), a BigDataViewer window in which selected Views can be visualized will open along with the BigStitcher main window. For other datasets, you can open BigDataViewer manually via the '''right-click menu''' by clicking {{bc|Displaying|Display in BigDataViewer(on/off)}}. If a BigDataViewer window is currently open, clicking this will close it.

For help on using BigDataViewer, you can either click {{bc|Help|Show Help}} in the BigDataViewer window or consult the BigDataViewer [[BigDataViewer#Usage|documentation]] on this Wiki.

In the BigDataViewer window accompanying the BigStitcher, you can switch between color schemes by pressing {{Key|c}} in the BigSitcher main window. A single press will switch between per-view and per-channel coloring. Pressing {{Key|c}} repeatedly will cycle through different colors.

=== Displaying selected views as ImageJ images ===

In addition to toggling the BigDataViewer, you can also display selected views one-by-one as standard ImageJ images using the '''Displaying''' functions in the '''right-click menu'''.

* Using {{bc|Displaying|Display Raw Image(s)}} in the ''right-click menu'', you can open the selected views as 16-bit or 32-bit images in ImageJ.

* Using {{bc|Displaying|Max-Projection}}, you can generate maximum-intensity projections of the selected view stacks and display them as ImageJ images.
