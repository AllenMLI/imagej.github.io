| message = The '''''very best''''' way to get help with ImageJ is to subscribe to the [[Mailing Lists|ImageJ mailing list]]. There are ~2000 subscribers, with many experts on both scientific and technical topics.

The ImageJ community firmly believes in [[open source]], including public discussion of the software. In this way, each question benefits not only the one asking, but everyone subscribed to the lists, and everyone who subsequently does a web search on the same topic, thanks to the [http://list.nih.gov/archives/imagej.html mailing list archives].
