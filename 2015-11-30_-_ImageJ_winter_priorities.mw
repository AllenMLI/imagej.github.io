It's [[2015-06-15_-_Major_updates_in_the_works|that time again]] - in this winter update the ImageJ team would like to let the community know where we're at, what's next, and what tasks we see as the most important to keep ImageJ moving forward.

==Top priority==

First and foremost, we're on the cusp of submitting a paper describing the structure of ImageJ2. This will mark a critical step in the establishment of the ImageJ2 brand and serve as a foundation for future investigations.

On the technical side, {{Person|Rueden}} just wrote the first ImageJ code using Java 8 functionality, which will continue drive our [https://github.com/imagej/imagej/issues/135 need to migrate]. One recent and fundamental step in this direction is the release of the [[List_of_update_sites|3D update site]]: providing Java 7- and 8-compatible versions of 3D ImageJ plugins (previously relegated to Java 6).

==Next steps==

In the coming months we have several projects of interest. In approximate order of our priority:

* [https://github.com/scifio/scifio/tree/blocks-are-so-plane SCIFIO blockization] - better-integrating the [[ImgLib2]] data model and moving from Planes to a general block-based API
* [https://github.com/imagej/imagej-common/tree/rich-image Rich images] - a polishing pass at the ImageJ data model
* [https://github.com/scifio/scifio/tree/location-robust-io Robust-IO] - generalizing image I/O sources
* Increasing the sophistication of [[ImageJ_Ops|ImageJ Ops]]
* [https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/milestones/3.0.0 SciJava-Common 3.0]
* Increased collaboration with KNIME (we're pleased to have [https://github.com/gab1one Gabriel Eisendorf] on loan!)	
* Improved [https://github.com/imagej/imagej-legacy/tree/rap-dont-harmonize ImageJ1-ImageJ2 synchronization]
* Formalizing developer roles and responsibilities (which will make "Adopt-a-plugin" possible!)

==Long-term plans==
			
* Adding support for arbitrarily large blocks/planes (via google-maps style scaling)	
* Improved support for arbitrarily large images
* JavaFX-based UI
			
==Continued support==

While not directly tied to any one issue or reportable task, the ImageJ team will continue to support:

* In the ImageJ community - especially with the success of the new [http://forum.imagej.net/ forum]
* [http://loci.wisc.edu/ LOCI] scientific collaborations
* Technical training - via continued [http://imagej.net/Presentations#Workshops presentations, workshops] and wiki guides.
