The ImageJ team at [[LOCI]] would like to let the community know where we're at, what's next, and what tasks we see as the most important to keep ImageJ moving forward.

==Top priority==

First and foremost, we're on the cusp of submitting a paper describing the structure of ImageJ2 and is a critical step towards future funding efforts.

On the technical side, {{Person|Rueden}} just wrote the first ImageJ code using Java 8 functionality, which will continue drive our [https://github.com/imagej/imagej/issues/135 need to migrate]. One recent and fundamental step in this direction is the release of the [[List_of_update_sites|3D update site]]: providing Java 7- and 8-compatible versions of 3D ImageJ plugins (previously relegated to Java 6).

==Next steps==

In the coming months we have several projects of interest. In approximate order of our priority:

* [https://github.com/scifio/scifio/tree/blocks-are-so-plane SCIFIO blockization] - better-integrating the [[ImgLib2]] data model and moving from Planes to a general block-based API
* [https://github.com/imagej/imagej-common/tree/rich-image Rich images] - a polishing pass at the ImageJ data model
* [https://github.com/scifio/scifio/tree/location-robust-io Robust-IO] - generalizing image I/O sources
* Increasing the sophistication of [[ImageJ_Ops|ImageJ Ops]]
* [https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/milestones/3.0.0 SciJava-Common 3.x]
* Increased collaboration with KNIME ([[LOCI]] is pleased to have {{Person|gab1one}} on loan from Konstanz!)
* Improved {{GitHub | org=imagej | repo=imagej-legacy | issue=86 | label=ImageJ1-ImageJ2 synchronization}}
* [http://forum.imagej.net/t/project-developer-roles/206 Formalizing developer roles and responsibilities] (which will make an "Adopt-a-plugin" program possible!)

==Long-term plans==

* Better support for arbitrarily large planes (via google-maps style scaling)
* Improved support for arbitrarily large images (i.e., with huge numbers of planes or blocks)
* JavaFX-based UI

==Continued support==

While not directly tied to any one issue or reportable task, [[LOCI]] will continue to support:

* The ImageJ communityâ€”especially with the success of the new [http://forum.imagej.net/ forum]
* [http://loci.wisc.edu/ LOCI] scientific collaborations
* Technical training, via continued [http://imagej.net/Presentations#Workshops presentations, workshops] and wiki guides.
