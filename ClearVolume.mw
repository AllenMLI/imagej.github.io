== Problems and Solutions ==
We work constantly on improving the Fiji and KNIME plugins. Help us doing so by letting us know if you encounter problems.

* Problem: on a Mac, after ClearVolume opens in Fiji I see a large grey area where the 3D viewer should be.
* Solution: we work on a fix... so far, double click on the grey area to switch to full screen, then double click again to go back to window mode.

== What is ClearVolume? ==
ClearVolume is a volume renderer developed at MPI-CBG. Its sources are open and can be cloned from [https://github.com/ClearVolume on GitHub]. We hope to provide our users soon with an adequate publication that can be cited in case you used ClearVolume for your research.

Channel LUTs, transparency, rendering quality, etc. can easily be set in the plugins user interface. We thank Tzumin Lee's group at Janelia for being allowed to use their twin-spot MARCM (Yu et al., Nature Neuroscience, 2009) labeled neurons.]]</center>

== Installing ClearVolume in Fiji or ImageJ2 ==

# Download Fiji or ImageJ2 from [http://imagej.net/Downloads here].
# Start Fiji/ImageJ2 and launch the updater ('''Help - Update...''')
# Click on '''Manage update sites''', tick the box next to '''ClearVolume''', and hit '''Close'''.
# Confirm the update/installation by clicking '''Apply changes''' and restart Fiji/ImageJ as suggested by the updater.

In order to use ClearVolume in Fiji you will have to start Fiji using a Java version above 1.6. We suggest to use Java 8, but Java 7 is fine too.
Depending on your operating system the way to do so is slightly different.

; Windows
* If you do not have installed Java, do so by following [https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml these instructions]. We recommend you to install the latest version (unless you know what you are doing).
* Open '''Fiji.app''' and delete the containing folder '''java''' from it if it exists. This will prevent that Fiji/ImageJ2 launches the outdated Java version it currently ships with.

; MacOS (>OSX 10.8 only, since OpenGL 3.3 must be supported)
* If you do not have installed Java, do so by following [https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml these instructions]. We recommend you to install the latest version (unless you know what you are doing).
* Currently Fiji/ImageJ2 has to be run from a terminal window in order to use launch using a user installed Java version. Detailed instructions can be found [http://fiji.sc/Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_do_I_launch_ImageJ_with_a_different_version_of_Java.3F in this FAQ].
* A typical launch command would then look similar to this: 
*: <code>/Applications/Fiji.app/Contents/MacOS/ImageJ-macosx --java-home /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jre1.8.0_25.jdk/Contents/Home/</code>

; Linux
* If you do not have installed Java, do so by following [https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml these instructions]. We recommend you to install the latest version (unless you know what you are doing).
* Currently Fiji/ImageJ2 has to be run from a terminal window in order to use launch using a user installed Java version. Detailed instructions can be found [http://fiji.sc/Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_do_I_launch_ImageJ_with_a_different_version_of_Java.3F in this FAQ].
* A typical launch command would then look similar to this: 
*: <code>$HOME/ImageJ.app/ImageJ-linux64 --java-home /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64</code>

'''''MacOS/Linux Nerd Tip:''''' Edit the file '''.bash_profile''' (Mac) or '''.bashrc''' (Linux) located in your home folder and add an adequately modified line like:
: <code>alias fiji='/Applications/Fiji.app/Contents/MacOS/ImageJ-macosx --java-home /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_25.jdk/Contents/Home/'</code> (Mac)
: <code>alias fiji='$HOME/ImageJ.app/ImageJ-linux64 --java-home /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64'</code> (Linux)
: After restarting the terminal you can start Fiji simply by typing '''<code>fiji</code>'''.

== Other ways to use ClearVolume ==
; KNIME
: The ClearVolume team provides a plugin for KNIME Image Processing. See [http://tech.knime.org/book/clearvolume this page] for details.
; Stand-alone
: The original purpose of ClearVolume is to bring live volumetric rendering to modern microscopy. Please check the [https://clearvolume.github.io/ClearVolume/ wiki on GibHub] for detailed informations.
