}}== Problems and Solutions ==
We work constantly on improving the Fiji and KNIME plugins. Help us doing so by letting us know if you encounter problems.

* '''Problem:''' on a Linux machine ClearVolume would not start but throw an ugly exception like
*: <code>java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError at clearvolume.renderer.opencl.OpenCLAvailability...</code>.
* '''Solution:''' you might not have OpenCL installed or your installation is corrupted.
*: On Ubuntu the following instructions turned out to be useful for some of our users: [http://askubuntu.com/questions/541114/how-to-make-opencl-work-on-14-10-nvidia-331-89-drivers http://askubuntu.com/questions/541114/how-to-make-opencl-work-on-14-10-nvidia-331-89-drivers]

* '''Problem:''' on a Mac, after ClearVolume opens in Fiji I see a large grey area where the 3D viewer should be.
* '''Solution:''' we work on a fix... so far, double click on the grey area to switch to full screen, then double click again to go back to window mode.

<center>[[File:ClearVolumeInFiji.png|border|750px|thumb|The main ClearVolume plugin can render volumetric multi-channel data. Channel LUTs, transparency, rendering quality, etc. can easily be set in the plugins user interface. We thank Tzumin Lee's group at Janelia for being allowed to use their twin-spot MARCM (Yu et al., Nature Neuroscience, 2009) labeled neurons.]]</center>
<center>[[File:ClearVolumeNetworkClientInFiji.png|750px|thumb|The ClearVolume network client can be started from Fiji/ImageJ2 and enables users to receive volumetric data from a remote source, e.g. live from a microscope in the basement of your collaborators institute.]]</center>
