== Problems and Solutions ==
We work constantly on improving the Fiji and KNIME plugins. Help us doing so by letting us know if you encounter problems.

* '''Problem:''' on a Linux machine ClearVolume would not start but throw an ugly exception like
*: <code>java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError at clearvolume.renderer.opencl.OpenCLAvailability...</code>.
* '''Solution:''' you might not have OpenCL installed or your installation is corrupted.
*: On Ubuntu the following instructions turned out to be useful for some of our users: [http://askubuntu.com/questions/541114/how-to-make-opencl-work-on-14-10-nvidia-331-89-drivers http://askubuntu.com/questions/541114/how-to-make-opencl-work-on-14-10-nvidia-331-89-drivers]

* '''Problem:''' on a Mac, after ClearVolume opens in Fiji I see a large grey area where the 3D viewer should be.
* '''Solution:''' we work on a fix... so far, double click on the grey area to switch to full screen, then double click again to go back to window mode.

== What is ClearVolume? ==
ClearVolume is a volume renderer developed at MPI-CBG. Its sources are open and can be cloned from [https://github.com/ClearVolume on GitHub]. We hope to provide our users soon with an adequate publication that can be cited in case you used ClearVolume for your research.

Channel LUTs, transparency, rendering quality, etc. can easily be set in the plugins user interface. We thank Tzumin Lee's group at Janelia for being allowed to use their twin-spot MARCM (Yu et al., Nature Neuroscience, 2009) labeled neurons.]]</center>

# Start Fiji/ImageJ2 and launch the updater ('''Help - Update...''')
# Click on '''Manage update sites''', tick the box next to '''ClearVolume''', and hit '''Close'''.
# If you use an older Fiji installation you MUST also check and install the '''Java-8''' update site. For more recent Fiji installations this update site will already be selected.
# Confirm the update/installation by clicking '''Apply changes''' and restart Fiji/ImageJ as suggested by the updater.
