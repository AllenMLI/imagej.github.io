== Purpose ==

Promote plugins, macros and scripts created by the Computing in Signal and Image in Medicine research group (CSIM). All the code implemented here have a specific applications, where are related with the basic image analysis such as image filtering, registration, feature extraction  and others.
Please, be free to install your plugins, macros and scripts form the ImageJ Updater or even contribut with our codes in GitHub repository ({{GitHub | org = CSIM-Toolkits | repo = ImageJ}}).

== Source code ==
The ImageJ sources codes are available on GitHub repository: {{GitHub | org = CSIM-Toolkits | repo = ImageJ}}.

== Publication ==

Here it will be found some publications of our research group with respect the image and signal processing methods developed in our laboratory. If any future research will be made using our methods, please cite one of the bottom published articles.
