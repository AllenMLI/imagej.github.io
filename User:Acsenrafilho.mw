}}== Purpose ==

Promote plugins, macros and scripts created by the Computing in Signal and Image in Medicine research group (CSIM). All the code implemented here have a specific applications, where are related with the basic image analysis such as image filtering, registration, feature extraction  and others.
Please, be free to install our plugins, macros and scripts from the ImageJ Updater or even contribute with our codes in the GitHub repository ({{GitHub | org = CSIM-Toolkits | repo = ImageJ | label = GitHub CSIM-ImageJ repository}}).

== Avaiable Methods ==

Here is a list with the available methods for ImageJ. If you want use any of these methods, please see the Update manager in Fiji (ImageJ) menu.

=== Anomalous Filters === 
[http://sites.imagej.net/AnomalousDiffusionFilter wiki page]
A PlugInFilter for the two different methods for image filtering: Anisotropic Anomalous Diffusion and Isotropic Anomalous Diffusion. Both methods description can be found in the Physics in Medicine and Biology article [http://], which is also referenced in this page, and have a discrete solution of generalized diffusion heat equation (also know as porous media equation). 

In summary, the anomalous diffusion filters are generalized methods that are proposed using the new anomalous distribution probability function (PDF) paradigm, also called ''q-Gaussian'' PDF. These new filters are capable to build both classic and anomalous diffusion process, which is related to the anomalous parameter, called q value. When q=1 it returns the classic diffusion methods, both anisotropic diffusion (Perona and Malik method) and Gaussian filter (usual Gaussian filter widely knows in several filtering applications). On the contrary, when q ≠ 1 the anomalous diffusion filters uses the q-Gaussian probability distribution to attenuate the local noise present in each neighborhood around each pixel of the image. 

Please, see our reference articles to find out more details about the parameters necessary to run properly the anomalous diffusion filters.

'''Update notes:'''

*''Feb-01-2015'': The methods are capable to process image stacks, however, all the filtering method still is performed in bidimensional images.

=== Noise Generator ===

In this specific PlugIn we offer a tool to create different noise image with several probability distributions, where could be useful in some biological and medical studies. Some noise probability examples are the Gaussian, Rayleigh and Colored noises (Brown, pink and other 1/f noises).

== Source code ==
The ImageJ source codes are available on GitHub repository: {{GitHub | org = CSIM-Toolkits | repo = ImageJ | label = GitHub-ImageJ source codes}}. If you want contribute with our applications, please enter in contact! It would be great to share our method implementations with you.

== Who we are ==

We are a computational laboratory dedicated with image and signal processing and analysis. Our group is held in the Ribeirão Preto city, São Paulo state, Brazil. Our research group works directly with several applications related to image and signal issues. Registration, tissue segmentation, filtering, analysis and feature extraction are some examples of our range studies. Also, our goal is to improve and create suitable tools for image and signal applied in medical and biological research. Please, see the reference articles cited here in this Wiki to see some of our publications. If you want to know more about our group and research opportunities, be free to enter in contact with us in our [http://dcm.ffclrp.usp.br/csim website]

== Publication ==

Here it will be found some publications of our research group with respect the image and signal processing methods developed in our laboratory. If any future research will be made using our methods, please cite one of the bottom published articles.
