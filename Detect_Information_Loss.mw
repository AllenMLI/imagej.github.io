Suppose you are given some images by as colleague, or have some images of your own, and you suspect that they may have been damaged by compression artifacts or brightness/contrast adjustment. Worse, you may have some images that you suspect might have been captured in such a way that information was missed or lost at the image capture stage due to bad detector settings. How can you detect these problems in an image?

Lets open a sample image and check it out:

In Fiji, do "File - Open Sample Images - FluorescentCells.tiff, to open a three colour channel "pretty" iimage of some fixed and stained cells grown on glass. 
Click the image then press "i" to see info about the image.

Questions you should ask before quantifying information from images:

*Q) Has there been lossy compression?
*Q) Is the intensity information saturated / clipped / overexposed?
*Q) Is there a problem with uniform background / detector offset?
