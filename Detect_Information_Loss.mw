Suppose you are given some images by as colleague, or have some images of your own, and you suspect that they may have been damaged by compression artifacts or brightness/contrast adjustment. Worse, you may have some images that you suspect might have been captured in such a way that information was missed or lost at the image capture stage due to bad detector settings. How can you detect these problems in an image?

Lets open a sample image and check it out:

In Fiji, do "File - Open Sample Images - FluorescentCells.tiff, to open a three colour channel "pretty" iimage of some fixed and stained cells grown on glass. 
Click the image then press "i" to see info about the image. The slider under the image is to change between the three colour channels, and you can see the colour of the border and the writing at the top of the image in the information bar change colour accordingly (the meta data of which channel is what colour was stored in the tiff file, but your images may or may not have that meta data!)

To Begin with, we should split the three color channel images into separate windows so we can inspect them and manipulate them separately: Select the FluorescentCells image and

'''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossy_data_compression Lossy Compression]:''' First, we can interrogate the red channel, and see of there are any [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossy_data_compression lossy compression] artifacts visible by eye: Click the magnifying glass icon in the Fiji main window and left click to zoom in to an area of interest (left click zooms in, right click zooms out again). 

You should see something like the image below. Can you see that there are square shaped artifacts in the image which are 8x8 pixels? These are lossy JPEG compression artifacts. The image intensity data is messed up... so you would not want to quantify intensity data from an image like that. Never use lossy JPEG or other lossy compression to store scientific data. Lossy compression is good for making movies etc smaller in file size, but bad for measurements afterwards. Images in PDF files of published research articles are usually lossy compressed, so its hard or impossible to repeat the image processing they did because the image data is messed up. This is a big problem in scientific publication in biological sciences, and we need to fix it: We need an online image database where data is publishes for others to down load and analyse, as is required by scientific publishing in other fields, eg x-ray crystallography for protein 3D structure and DNA/genome etc. sequencing. I don't know why biological imaging thinks its so special...

'''Intensity Saturation or Clipping or Over Exposure:''' Next we can have a look to see of the image has been acquired or manipulated in such a way that the highest intensity information has been lost, due to detector [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge-coupled_device CCD], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photomultiplier PMT], etc. saturation / over exposure, such that the intensity scale of the information is clipped off at the top, like a mountain with the peak removed... so you can't tell how high it was. 

<p>The easiest way to detect intensity saturation is to look at the intensity distribution histogram of the image. This is simply a histogram showing how many pixels in the image have which intensity. If there are too many pixels (or even any!) pixels that have an intensity value at the maximum of the scale, then there is lost intensity information. For an 8 bit scale image, which has intensity values from 0 to 255, the pixels with a value of 255 might really be 255, or they might all have different higher values, like 450, or 11,345 but you have no way of knowing. The information is '''LOST''', and gone '''FOREVER'''. No amount of clever image processing can really get it back :-(

To make an intensity histogram from  image, in the Fiji menus select "Analyze-Histogram". Then click the "Log" button in the histogram window to see the histogram in logarithmic scale (this is handy for fluorescence images that are often mostly black). You can see in the last "bin" (the 255 intensity bin) that there are 108 pixels that have intensity of 255... but are they really 255 or more than that... you have no idea. Worse still, it is often true that you are most interested in the brightest objects... but these are the ones that the true intensity information has been lost for   :-O

Questions you should ask before quantifying information from images:

*Q) Has there been lossy compression?
*Q) Is the intensity information saturated / clipped / overexposed?
*Q) Is there a problem with uniform background / detector offset?
