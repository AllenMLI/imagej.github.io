=Sholl Analysis=
There are two [https://imagej.net/Sholl_Analysis Sholl Analysis] commands available in SNT's ''Analysis'' menu. The {{bc|Analysis|Shuoll Analysis...}} option provides a set of pre-defined focal points the user can choose from. Note for the morphology-based focal points (e.g., ''Soma'', ''Root node(s): Primary apical dendrite(s)'') , the relevant morphology tag(s) must be assigned to the set of paths considered by the analysis. To select a focal point manually, see the following section.
==Sholl Analysis (by Focal Point)==
[[Image:Snt-Sholl-Coarse-Intructions.png|right|thumb|200px|Initiating Sholl Analysis: coarse method]]
It is also possible to initiate [https://imagej.net/Sholl_Analysis Sholl Analysis] on a tracing in the canvas by manually selecting a focal point. You can do it coarsely by right-clicking near a node and choosing ''Sholl Analysis at Nearest Node'' from the contextual menu (Shortcut: {{key|Alt}} + {{key|Shift}} + {{key|A}}.  

Alternatively, for precise positioning of the center of analysis:
# Mouse over the path of interest. Press {{key|G}} to activate it.
# Press {{key|Alt}}+{{key|Shift}} to select a node along the path.
# Press {{key|Alt}}+{{key|Shift}}+{{key|A}} to start analysis.

The Sholl dialog created by this approach differs slightly from the dialog created by running the {{bc|Analyze|Sholl|Sholl Analysis (From Tracings)...}} plugin in the main Fiji menu. First, the center of analysis is automatically taken from the nearest (or exact) node where the user clicks. In addition to morphology and custom tag filters, the ''Path filtering'' drop-down menu provides an additional option to restrict the analysis to the subset of paths selected in the Path Manager. Another advantage is that the display canvas allows the radius step size to be previewed visually. To do this, toggle on the ''Preview'' checkbox under the ''Sampling'' section and experiment with different step sizes.

In addition to the Sholl Profile plot and table, the output of the analysis can be visualized as a color mapping of the reconstruction and as a [https://imagej.net/Simple_Neurite_Tracer:_Sholl_analysis#Sholl_Image Sholl Image]. To color code the tracing, choose ''Color coded paths'' from the ''Annotations'' drop-down menu and select a Lut from the ''Annotations Lut'' drop-down menu before pressing ''Run Analysis''.  To output the Sholl Image, choose ''3D viewer labels image'' from the ''Annotations'' drop-down menu and select the desired Lut before running the analysis.

=Strahler Analysis=
To conduct [https://imagej.net/Strahler_Analysis Strahler Analysis] on the current contents of the Path Manager, choose the {{bc|Utilities|Strahler Analysis}} command in the main SNT dialog. This command will output the results of the analysis as a table and plot. These figures contains statistics on the group of paths associated with each Horton-Strahler Number. Note that this feature analyzes traced reconstructions. To run Strahler analysis on images, use the {{bc|Analyze|Skeleton|Strahler Analysis...}} plugin in the main Fiji dialog.

=Path Order Analysis=
Found at {{bc|Analysis|Path Order Analysis}} in the main SNT dialog, this option analyzes the Paths in the Path Manager based on [https://www.mbfbioscience.com/help/nx11/Content/Branch%20order/Branch_Order.htm Branch Order]. Produces a table of results and a plot similar to the ''Strahler Analysis'' option.

=Measurements=
[[Image:Snt-Measurements-List.png|right|thumb|200px|''Measure...'' dialog]]
SNT provides several ways to measure reconstructions. A comprehensive selection of measurements can be found by going to {{bc|Analysis|Measure...}}. in the main SNT dialog. To quickly measure tracings with a common set of statistics, choose {{bc|Analysis|Quick Measurements}}. In both cases the results of the measurements are displayed in a table. To get measurements only on a select group of Paths, first select the Paths you want to measure in the Path Manager and choose either option from the  {{bc|Analyze}} menu in the Path Manager. Batch measurements of reconstructions can be accomplished via scripting. See ''Measure_Multiple_Files.py'' in the SNT [[https://imagej.net/SNT:_Scripting#Script_Templates Script Templates]] for a basic example.

=Custom Analyses=
It is possible to script your own analysis routines. See [https://imagej.net/SNT:_Scripting SNT:_Scripting] for the link to SNT's API as well as script templates demonstrating a range of analysis possibilities.
