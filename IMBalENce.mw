= '''Overview''' =

This is a suite of ImageJ plugins that are used for processing images acquired from electron microscopes. Currently the main focus is on SEM images, but I will keep working on streamline the image processing of both SEM and TEM data.

= '''Components and Functions''' =

Click the links below to find more about each tool.

# [ [[SEM FEI metadata scale|SEM FEI metadata and scale]] ] reads FEI SEM acquisition metadata from tiff tags and set image scale based on pixel size.
# [ [[SEM FEI databar cut|SEM FEI databar cut]] ] cuts databar from FEI SEM images, then save image and databar as individual files. (Page in preparation)
# [ [[SEM JOEL Scale|SEM JOEL Scale]] ] sets image scale based on pixel size store in the .txt file associated with SEM image.
# [ [[SEM Zeiss metadata scale|SEM Zeiss metadata scale]] ] Upcoming soon...
# [ [[SEM Hitachi metadata scale|SEM Hitachi metadata scale]] ] Upcoming soon...
# [ [[Image Annotation|Image feature measurement annotation]] ] measures and mark the size of features. It annotates the length of line tool in a calibrated image and export measurement results. 
# [ [[Flat field correction|Flat field correction]] ] Applies flat filed correction to a folder of images for large area mapping to mitigate chess pattern after stitching. (Page in preparation)
# [ [[TIA .ser folder export | TEM .ser .dm3 folder export]] ] This tool convert TIA EM image .ser files in a folder to TIFF format.

= '''Installation''' =

== Installation via FIJI updater ==

1. [https://fiji.sc FIJI] (Fiji Is Just ImageJ) should be installed on your computer. 

2. Click “Help / Update…” to open the FIJI updater. If it’s the first time updating your FIJI, it might take some time to download the update files and may also require to restart FIJI a few times. Once done, click “Help / Update…” again to bring up the ImageJ updater window.

If you only want to use one of the plugins you can follow these steps:

1. The source code of these macro scripts can be viewed on [https://github.com/IMBalENce/EM-tool my github page].

2. Download the plugin you want.

3. Save .ijm files in the desired location within your imageJ application

4. Go to "Plugins/Macros/install..." to add the macros, or drag-and-drop the .ijm file into ImageJ/FIJI
