== What does it do? ==

This plugin stabilizes jittery image stacks using the Lucas-Kanade algorithm. It supports both grayscale and color images.

[[File:exemple.gif]]

== How does it work? ==

It uses the currently shown slice in an image stack as the initial reference, or "template";
It estimates the geometrical transformation needed to best align each of the other slices with the "template". The estimation and alignment are performed using the Lucas-Kanade algorithm;
Once a slice is aligned, the "template" will be updated on the fly using the formula: new_template = a * old_template + (1 - a) * newly_aligned_slice, where "a" is the "template update coefficient" that can be adjusted when the plugin is run.

Hint: To process very large image stacks, import the stack with the "Use Virtual Stack" option enabled. The plugin will prompt you for an output directory to store the stabilized image sequence.

== Change log ==
2008/02/07: First version

2008/02/10: Optimized for speed using gradient pyramids

2008/02/12: Performed further speed optimizations and bug fixes

2008/02/14: Added support for affine transformation

2008/03/15: Made user interface improvements

2008/05/02: Added support for macro recordering (thanks to Christophe Leterrier at univmed.fr)

2009/01/11: Added support for logging transformation coefficients (can be reapplied to another stack using Image Stabilizer Log Applier)

2009/01/11: The stabilization process can be interrupted by pressing 'ESC' or by closing the image

2009/01/20: Fixed a runtime error when the user does not select the Log_Transformation_Coefficients checkbox (thanks to Nico Stuurman at UCSF)

2009/06/12: Fixed a bug that affected 32-bit float input images (thanks to Derek Bailey)
