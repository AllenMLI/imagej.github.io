}}The Atlas Toolkit plugin is a collection of tools developed to achieve group-wise elastic registration of 3D objects by decomposing the alignment problem into a sequence of orthogonal 2D elastic registrations, for which each object is registered to every other. These 2D elastic registrations are powered by the [[BUnwarpJ]] plugin, and registration is guided by the gross morphology of the corresponding 3D objects, which can be defined using the [[Segmentation Editor]] plugin.

==Installation of the plugin==
The plugin can be quickly installed via the project's update site. Please refer to the [[Update_Sites | '''tutorial''']] on how to add our update site to your Fiji installation.
Our update site has the following URL:

  '''<code><nowiki>http://sites.imagej.net/GrocottLab/</nowiki></code>'''

==What's in the toolkit?==
Atlas Toolkit includes a number of different tools to help building atlases. Many of these will be of limited use/interest. For those interested in 3D image registration the most important tools will be:

3. Label Registration 3D.

4. Apply Label Registration.

This complete list of tools is as follows:

1. Extract Nuclear Signal.

2. Project to Segment Label.

3. Label Registration 3D.

4. Apply Label Registration.

5. Merge Registered Volumes.

6. Sample Volumes for Clustering.

7. Cluster Viewer.
