After opening a XML file the main windows will appear in the '''Stitching Mode'''. In this mode all necessary steps for image stitching are performed

=== The main window ===

* At the top of the window '''(1)''', you can switch between Stitching and MultiView mode. 

* Also at the top of the window '''(2)''' the name of the currently open .XML will appear. '''Info''' shows extended information of all Views in the current XML file. The '''Save''' button saves all current changes done to the XML.

* In the center of the window a list '''(3)''' shows all available views for the selected Timepoint and Angle.

* The views can be grouped by different attributes '''(5)'''. In this case views are grouped by Channels and Illuminations.

* In Stitching mode, only one Timepoint and Angle is displayed. Different Timepoints or Angles are accesed by the drop-down menu at the bottom '''(4)'''.

=== The BigDataViewer window ===

If the dataset is in a format suitable for quick visualization by [[BigDataViewer]] (e.g. multiresolution HDF5 or virtually loading), a BigDataViewer window in which selected Views can be visualized will open along with the BigStitcher main window. For other datasets, you can open BigDataViewer manually via the menu.
