{{Scripting}}
A thin wrapper around [http://www.scala-lang.org/ Scala] is currently available on the [[List_of_update_sites|Java 8 update site]], providing Scala scripting capabilities in ImageJ. However, support is ''very new'' and ''largely untested''. Support will improved later, as time allows.
