{{UpdateSites}}

== Following an update site ==

{{Fiji | The [[Fiji]] distribution of ImageJ ships with both the ''ImageJ'' and ''Fiji'' sites enabled. You can transform your ImageJ installation into a Fiji one simply by enabling the ''Fiji'' update site.}}
Out of the box, ImageJ has only the core '''ImageJ''' update site enabled.
* To enable additional features, choose ''Update'' from the ''Help'' menu, then click the "Manage update sites" button.

For further details, see [[How to follow a 3rd party update site]].

== Creating your own update site ==

Anyone can share their extensions ([[plugins]], [[scripts]], etc.) by '''creating their own update site'''. You can use ImageJ's '''personal update site''' service (hosted on the [http://sites.imagej.net/ ImageJ web server]), or host it on your own server.

See [[How to set up and populate an update site]] for instructions.

== Frequently asked questions ==

=== How do I make my update site appear in ImageJ's ''Manage update sites'' dialog? ===

The dialog is based on the [[List of update sites]] wiki page. You can edit that page to add your own update site.

=== How do I remove a file from my update site? ===

An update site is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control revision control] system where nothing is ever really deleted from the history.

Hence, there are two levels of removal: marking a file '''obsolete''', and '''deleting a file completely from the history''':

* You can mark any file previously uploaded as obsolete. Just delete it from your local installation, then launch the updater, right click and choose "Mark obsolete." This will not delete old versions of the file, but will ensure anyone updating to the latest version of your update site will no longer download that file.
* Deleting a file from the history is strongly not recommended, but if you ''must'' do so (e.g., for legal or privacy reasons):
** If you using a [[Personal Update Sites|personal update site]], then [[Help:Contents|contact an ImageJ administrator]] to have the offending file(s) removed.
** If you are hosting your own update site, then you must delete all versions of the file from the file system, ''and'' edit the ''db.xml.gz'' file to remove the ''<plugin>'' entry as well as any ''<dependency>'' elements in other entries which reference it.

=== How do I set a password for my personal update site? ===

Use [[Special:ChangeUploadPassword|this page]] to set a password for ''uploading'' content.

If you want to restrict which users can ''access'' your update site, please note that the [[Personal Update Sites]] service is only intended for freely available plugins. To restrict user access, you will need to host the update site yourself, sharing the URL only with your customers. Implementing an authentication scheme on top of an ImageJ update site is outside the scope of ImageJâ€”consider using something like [http://oauth.net/ OAuth].

=== How do I delete my personal update site? ===

If you want to completely remove your update site, [[Help:Contents|contact an ImageJ administrator]] to have the site removed.

=== Can I manipulate the files on my update site directly? (E.g., via WebDAV?) ===

Please don't! Update sites are intended to be accessed ''only'' via ImageJ's [[Updater]]. There is important metadata in the ''db.xml.gz'' file which ''must'' be kept in sync with the files in the directory structure. Otherwise, your update site will stop working properly.
