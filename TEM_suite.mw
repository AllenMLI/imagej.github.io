This is a suite of TEM plugins for FIJI that are designed for the Electron Microscipist who is constantly indexing electron diffraction patterns. Included in the suite are:
# [[calc dSpace|calc dSpace]] is a simple way to find interplanar spacing values in imageJ.
# [[get dSpace|get dSpace]] is a more accurate and advanced way of finding d-spacing.
# [[pub Montage|pub Montage]] is a high quality montaging plugin designed for figure submission to a peer review journal.


== Installation via FIJI updater ==
The easiest way to install the TEM suite of plugins is to use the FIJI updater:
# ''Help'' > ''Update''
# Click the ''Manage update sites'' button in the ''ImageJ Updater Window''.
# In the ''Manage update sites window'' scroll down to the '''TEM suite''' entry and check the box in the left hand column.
# Close the ''Manage Update Sites'' window and click the ''Apply Changes'' button on the ''ImageJ Updater Window''.
# ''Help'' > ''Refresh Menus''
# Restart ImageJ.

This will install the plugins in a plugin/sripts/TEM folder, which has the advantage of creating it's own menu item in ImageJ, so you don't have to go hunting for it in the massive Plugins menu.

== Manual Installation ==
# The text of these scripts can be viewed on the [http://sites.imagej.net/Makoten/plugins/Scripts/TEM/ update site] 
# Click on the plugin you want.
# Copy the text of the desired plugin and paste it into a blank file in imageJ.
# Save it wherever you wish to access the file with a .ijm file extension.
# Restart ImageJ.
