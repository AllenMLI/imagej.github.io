This is a suite of TEM plugins for FIJI that are designed for the Electron Microscipist who is constantly indexing electron diffraction patterns. Included in the suite are:
# [[calc dSpace|calc dSpace]] is a simple way to find interplanar spacing values in imageJ.
# [[get dSpace|get dSpace]] is a more accurate and advanced way of finding d-spacing.
# [[pub Montage|pub Montage]] is a high quality montaging plugin designed for figure submission to a peer review journal.

== Getting Started ==
* Installation via FIJI updater:
# ''Help'' > ''Update''
# Click the ''Manage update sites'' button in the ImageJ Updater Window.
# In the new widow scroll down to the TEM suite entry and check the box in the left hand column.
# Close the ''Manage Update Sites'' window and click the ''Apply Changes'' button on the ImageJ Updater Window.

This will install the plugin in a plugin/sripts/TEM folder, which has the advantage of creating it's own menu item in ImageJ, so you don't have to go hunting for it in the massive Plugins menu.

* Manual Installation:
# The actual scripts text can be viewed on the [[http://sites.imagej.net/Makoten/plugins/Scripts/TEM/ update site]] if you click on the plugin you want.
# Copy the text of the desired plugin into a file and save it wherever you wish to save it in ImageJ.
# Restart ImageJ.
