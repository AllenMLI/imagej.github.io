This is a suite of useful imageJ plugins that are designed for analysis of images and diffraction patterns taken on a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). Included in the suite are:
# [[calc dSpace|calc dSpace]] is a simple way to find interplanar spacing values in imageJ.
# [[get dSpace|get dSpace]] is a more accurate and advanced way of finding d-spacing.
# [[pub Montage|pub Montage]] is a high quality montaging plugin designed for figure submission to a peer review journal.

== Getting Started ==
The following are ways of installing this suite of plugins. The first way is the easiest and fastest method, but the second way offers more freedom. 
'''Installation via FIJI updater:''' 
The easiest way to install the TEM suite of plugins is to use the FIJI updater:
# Download and install [https://fiji.sc/ FIJI]
# Start the updater with ''Help'' > ''Update''
# Click the ''Manage update sites'' button in the ''ImageJ Updater Window''
# In the ''Manage update sites window'' scroll down to the '''TEM suite''' entry and check the box in the left hand column
# Close the ''Manage Update Sites'' window and click the ''Apply Changes'' button on the ''ImageJ Updater Window''
# Restart ImageJ

This will install the plugins in a plugin/sripts/TEM folder, which has the advantage of creating it's own menu item in ImageJ, so you don't have to go hunting for it in the massive Plugins menu.

'''Manual Installation:''' 
If you want to just use one of the plugins or you want to place them in a different location, follow these steps:
# The text of these scripts can be viewed on the [http://sites.imagej.net/Makoten/plugins/Scripts/TEM/ update site] 
# Click on the plugin you want (make sure it is the most recent release)
# Copy the text of the desired plugin and paste it into a blank text file
# Save it with the extension .ijm in the desired location within your imageJ application
# Go to ''Help'' => ''Refresh Menus''
# Restart ImageJ
