== Purpose ==
This Fiji plugin loads trajectories from TrackMate, characterize them using TraJ and classificate them into normal diffusion, subdiffusion, confined diffusion and directed/active motion by a random forest approach (through Renjin)


== Examples ==


== Parameters ==
[[File:Trajclassifier_gui.png|300px|thumb]]
Minimal tracklength: Minimal number of positions in a trajectory. It has to be greater than the window size. As the window size should be at least 30, the same is true for the minimal tracklength.

Minimal segment size:

Resample rate:

Pixelsize:

Framerate

Use reduced model for confined motion
