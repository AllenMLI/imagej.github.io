== Purpose ==
This Fiji plugin loads trajectories from TrackMate, characterize them using [https://github.com/thorstenwagner/TraJ TraJ] and classificate them into normal diffusion, subdiffusion, confined diffusion and directed/active motion by a random forest approach (through Renjin)

=== Installation ===

Simply turn on the  [http://imagej.net/How_to_follow_a_3rd_party_update_site TraJClassifier update site].

== Introduction ==

Pleas start by reading the [https://github.com/thorstenwagner/TraJ/wiki#introduction introduction] of TraJ, because the TraJClassifier is build upon this library.

== Examples ==


== Parameters ==
[[File:Trajclassifier_gui.png|300px|thumb]]
'''Minimal tracklength:''' Minimal number of positions in a trajectory. It has to be greater than the window size. As the window size should be at least 30, the same is true for the minimal tracklength.

'''Window size:''' The parameter determines how many positions are used in the sliding window.

'''Minimal segment size:''' After classification of a trajectory it consistes of several segments. This parameter determines the minimal segment length. Segments smaller than this length will be removed. It is good rule of thumb to set this parameter to same value as the window size because segments which are smaller than the window size seems to be very error prone.

'''Resample rate:''' During the local analysis using a sliding window, one trajectory is splitted into several subtrajectories. In very noisy cases it could make sense to resample the subtrajectories to increase the signal to noise ratio (e.g. if the rate is set to 2, then only every second position is used in the trajectory). However, we belief that a trajectory should contain at least 30 position therefore the ratio of windowsize and the resample rate should be >= 30.

'''Pixelsize:''' Size of a single pixel in Âµm. However, if your TrackMate data is already scaled, set it to zero.

'''Framerate:''' Frames per second

Use reduced model for confined motion: 

'''Show IDs:''' Show trajectory IDs as overlay. The trajectories IDs given in the format PARENT ID:SEGMENT ID

'''Show overview classes:''' Show classes and color codes as overlay.

'''Remove global drift:'''  In some cases the particles are moving relativ to another object (e.g. a cell). When the object is moving approx. at a constant speed, than it could be possible to estimate it via a global drift estimation and remove this drift component from each trajectory.
