We have a modified ImageJ core that operates as Fiji's kernel. The source code is in a branch named 'master' in ImageJA repository.

Here is how to get fiji.git's ImageJA submodule to run Fiji:

First check out the submodule ImageJA in fiji/:

`$ git submodule init modules/ImageJA`  
`$ git submodule update modules/ImageJA`

Note: make sure that you have \_no\_ trailing slash after "modules/ImageJA". In other words, "modules/ImageJA/" will \_not\_ work.

Note: If the update finds a new revision to advance to, it will \_detach\_ the HEAD. That means that you will not be on any branch.

Therefore, if you want to work on ImageJA's *master* branch, you need to create a local branch:

`$ cd modules/ImageJA/`  
`$ git checkout -b master origin/master`

This only needs to be done once. You can now work with *git pull*, *git add*, *git commit* and *git push* to your heart's content.

If you update the ImageJA submodule with *git submodule update modules/ImageJA* on purpose or by accident, you will have to go back to the *master* branch before doing any work inside ImageJA:

`$ cd modules/ImageJA/`  
`$ git checkout master && git pull`
