## Presentation.

MaMuT is an end user plugin that combines the [BigDataViewer](/plugins/bdv) and [TrackMate](/plugins/trackmate) to provide an application that allow browsing, annotating and curating annotations for large image data.

The main window resembles the display panel of [TrackMate](/plugins/trackmate). It controls how the annotations are displayed. Using the *MaMuT Viewer* button, several views of the data can be launched. They will all be in sync. Each of them is an instance of the [BigDataViewer](/plugins/bdv).

We privileged annotations that are like lineages, or object followed over time (which is what [TrackMate](/plugins/trackmate) does). MaMuT ships [TrackScheme](/plugins/trackmate/trackscheme), the lineage browser taken from TrackMate.

However, MaMuT itself does not ship any fully-automated or tracking algorithm. It is meant for manual or semi-automatic annotation. Still, we made the GUI comfortable enough so that you can quickly generate rather large annotations. A semi-automated segmentation can help you generating quickly lineage branches from single cells.
