This plugin allows to apply a **similarity transformation** (rotation, translation and isotropic scaling) to a 2D image in an interactive way.

**Premises**: You need an image to be open.

**Use**:

1.  When calling the plugin, two points (represented as yellow PointRois) will be displayed on the image.
2.  Drag and drop the points to interactively transform the image with a **similarity model** (rotation, translation and isotropic scaling).
3.  If you are satisfied with the result, press ENTER, otherwise, press ESC.
