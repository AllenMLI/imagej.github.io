This plugin allows easy creation of figures for publications, reports, projects.

The idea of FigureJ is to consider **figure panels as views into datasets**.

So building a figure should not consist of many technical steps, but only selecting data that you want to display.

The software can take care of the rest, and **guarantee access to the raw data** and processing history.

Download, installation instructions and video tutorials can be found [here](https://imagejdocu.list.lu/plugin/utilities/figurej/start).

When using FigureJ for a research article, you can cite the following [article from Journal of Microscopy](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmi.12069/abstract).
