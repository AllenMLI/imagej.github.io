# Installation 
Activate the *Intensity Profile Tools* update site in Fiji.

# Usage
After installation, you get a new entry *Intensity Profile Tools* in the `>>` menu of the ImageJ toolbar.  
Clicking this menu will load 2 macro tools in the toolbar.  

- X/Y intensity profile panel tools
When clicked, this tool will create 2 intensity profile windows : one for the vertical and one for the horizontal profile of the active image.  

- X/Y Line Profile Tool
This is an interactive tool : when selected, hovering the mouse over an image will overlay a cross-over pattern with the vertical and horizontal line profile for the current X/Y mouse position.  
Double-clicking the icon allows setting the scale factor, to adjust the amplitude of the line plot.  

Original version of the code was contributed by Nicol√°s De Francesco and Jerome Mutterer.
