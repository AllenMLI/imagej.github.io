# Guidelines

(In progress)

These guidelines are meant to help users improve their automatic segmentation pipeline.

## Labeling the image

### Label important features of each class

<!---  Examples of labeling (eg objects too dim are labeled to background, background between two objects) -->

### Do not over label

<!--- Explain impact of over labeling on the segmentation -->

## Choosing filters

In cases where the default settings do not bring satisfactory results, changing the list of sigmas or the filters can be a game changer.

### Choosing the sigmas

Use sigmas as large as your objects in terms of pixels.
