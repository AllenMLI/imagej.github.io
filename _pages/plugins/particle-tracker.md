**Particle Tracker** is a 2D and 3D feature point-tracking tool for the automated detection and tracking of particle trajectories as recorded by video imaging in cell biology. It is part of the [MosaicSuite](http://mosaic.mpi-cbg.de/?q=downloads/imageJ), which also offers image segmentation, interaction analysis, and much more. The best way to install it is via the MOSAIC Fiji Update site, as described on the [MOSAIC web page](http://mosaic.mpi-cbg.de/?q=downloads/imageJ). The algorithm is described in Sbalzarini and Koumoutsakos (2005[^1]). A recent comparative study of many particle tracking tools has named this tool as one of the top choices: Chenouard et al. (2014[^2]).

Documentation is available as [html](http://mosaic.mpi-cbg.de/ParticleTracker/tutorial.html) and [pdf](http://mosaic.mpi-cbg.de/ParticleTracker/doc/ParticleTrackerUserManual.pdf).
