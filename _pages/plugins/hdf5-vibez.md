This plugin is an HDF5 reader/writer plugin for [ImageJ](/software/imagej) and [Fiji](/software/fiji). It is a continuation of the [original code](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/opensource/imagej_plugins/hdf5.html) by Matthias Schlachter, Olaf Ronneberger and Kun Liu.

HDF5 is a data format for storing extremely large and complex data collections. For more information, see the [official website](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5). The plugin uses the [jhdf5 library from ETH SIS](https://svnsis.ethz.ch/doc/hdf5/hdf5-19.04/JHDF5.pdf) for reading and writing HDF5 files.

For further details, see the {% include github org='fiji' repo='HDF5_Vibez' label='fiji/HDF5_Vibez' %} repository on GitHub.
