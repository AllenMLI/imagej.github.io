## Description

Multifrac is an ImageJ plugin for the analysis and characterization of 2D and 3D stack images. This tool is specifically designated for the analysis of soil pore structure and scaling behaviour and patterns therein. Main features of Multifrac are:

-   Monofractal analysis of black and white images
-   Multifractal analysis with box counting and gliding box methodologies ofr gray images.
-   Lacunarity analysis
-   Characteristic length and configuration entropy analysis.

This plugin has extensively used with real soil samples and results published in high impact factor journals.
