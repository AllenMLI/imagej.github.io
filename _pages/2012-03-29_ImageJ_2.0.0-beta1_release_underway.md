The release process has begun for ImageJ 2.0.0-beta1. We are currently resolving the [http://trac.imagej.net/milestone/imagej2-b1-initial few remaining tickets], and making the final preparations for the release. Once we have a release candidate, we will perform some internal testing for a day or two, and fix any showstopper bugs that we discover. At the same time, we will summarize the current design and major available features of ImageJ2 on the web site. Finally, once the documentation is in place, we will post and announce the release.

In summary, expect a release announcement some time next week!
