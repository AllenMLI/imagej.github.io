## Things to do...

Many of the topics here could user more explanation about why and when they would be used

  - Can mention why would we need to know java version required
  - There are two ways to create such a snapshotknown as a "thread dump" or "stack trace". – not clear

We need an info link back to the [Debugging](Debugging "wikilink") page and perhaps a pass over the content to make sure the concerns of the pages are nicely separated (user vs developer-facing content)

Other improvements

  - In “the other debug mode” debugitude – information on debugging, when to report a bug (via sidebar)
  - Unsupported Class Version Error, How to upgrade Java version – can add link
  - NoSuchMethodError: “Once you determine which update site(s) causes the issue, you can create a separate copy of ImageJ with only the unproblematic site(s) enabled” – needs to be reworded to clarify that multiple ImageJ installations are being recommended
