Image fusion

Drosophila embryo expressing His-YFP reconstructed from 7 view SPIM acquisition (lateral view (a-c)
and transversal views (d-f)). Due to incomplete acquisition of the sample volume in different views
strong line artifacts (white arrows) are apparent in the sections through average-fused, reconstructed
image (a,d). The non-linear blending suppresses these intensity discontinuities in both average (b,e)
and entropy fused image (c,f). Note the increased contrast achieved by content-based fusion (c,f).
