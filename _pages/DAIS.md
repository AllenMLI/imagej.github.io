The [Fiji](Fiji ) community is actively working towards tight integration with the [KNIME](KNIME ) workflow engine, which is maintained and developed by the de.NBI center CIBI. DAIS has a strong focus on further strengthening interoperability and integration of Fiji and KNIME, as well as bringing together their respective developer communities.
