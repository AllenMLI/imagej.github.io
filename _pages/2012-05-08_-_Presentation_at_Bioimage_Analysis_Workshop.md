On April 30 through May 1 we attended a Bioimage Analysis Workshop in Barcelona entitled "[Bioimage analysis software: is there a future beyond ImageJ?](ISBI_2012 "wikilink")" We presented the current status and future directions of [ImageJ2](ImageJ2 "wikilink").

It was great meeting with developers of related projects, including [OME](OME "wikilink"), [KNIME Image Processing](KNIME "wikilink"), [Icy](Icy "wikilink") and [BioImageXD](BioImageXD "wikilink")\! The big takeaway message of the workshop was interoperability: we are all striving to make our software work together well, so that users can combine them and benefit from all our efforts.
