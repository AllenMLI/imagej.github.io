On April 30 through May 1 we attended a Bioimage Analysis Workshop in Barcelona entitled "[Bioimage analysis software: is there a future beyond ImageJ?](ISBI_2012)" We presented the current status and future directions of [ImageJ2](ImageJ2).

It was great meeting with developers of related projects, including [OME](OME), [KNIME Image Processing](KNIME), [Icy](Icy) and [BioImageXD](BioImageXD)! The big takeaway message of the workshop was interoperability: we are all striving to make our software work together well, so that users can combine them and benefit from all our efforts.
