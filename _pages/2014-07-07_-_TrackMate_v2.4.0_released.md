We just released a new minor version of [TrackMate](TrackMate "wikilink"), that ships improvements to [TrackScheme](TrackScheme "wikilink") and bugfixes.

## Improvements

  - TrackScheme now has an outline panel, useful to navigate in large models.

  - TrackScheme has a better layout for tracks that have merge and split events.

<!-- end list -->

  - The 'Refresh' button on detector config panels is not present anymore. It's confusing and useless now that the quality value does not match pixel intensity at all.

<!-- end list -->

  - TrackMate has new logos and icons, made by Agnieszka Kawska @ [IlluScientia](http://www.illuscientia.com/).

## Bugfixes

  - Fixed several problems with the 'Copy Overlay' action.

<!-- end list -->

  - Fixed a severe TrackScheme bug, happening when creating links with invisible tracks.

<!-- end list -->

  - Fixed a detector crash when running a preview detection with 0 spots found.
