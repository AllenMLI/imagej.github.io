Thanks to ImageJ's [extensibility](extensibility "wikilink") via [plugins](plugins "wikilink"), it supports a lot of image formats\!

## Life sciences

The [OME Bio-Formats](Bio-Formats "wikilink") plugins provide support for over 130 file formats in microscopy, medical imaging, and related life science formats. Bio-Formats is included with the [Fiji](Fiji "wikilink") distribution of ImageJ. See also the Bio-Formats [list of supported formats](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/bio-formats/supported-formats.html).

## DICOM

ImageJ has some built-in support for the DICOM format, and there are also plugins for working with DICOM files. See the [DICOM](DICOM "wikilink") page for full details.

## HDF

The HDF5 [update site](update_site "wikilink") enables support for reading and writing [HDF5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format "wikilink") image data. Note that HDF5 is a very broad specification; the HDF5 plugin will not support all manner of HDF files, but only those written according to its constraints.

## Video

Out of the box, ImageJ has limited support for some video formats such as AVI and [QuickTime](QuickTime "wikilink"), and there are also plugins which extend ImageJ's support for videos. See the [Video](Video "wikilink") page for details.
