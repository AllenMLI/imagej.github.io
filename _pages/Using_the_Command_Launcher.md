One of the most useful functions of ImageJ is the *Command Launcher* (also known as *Command Finder*). The keyboard shortcut is {% include key content='Ctrl' %}+{% include key content='L' %} (or {% include key content='Command' %}+{% include key content='L' %} on Macs).

Once the window opens, just type part of the menu item you want to launch, and it will show you a list of commands that match that substring:

![](/media/Snapshot of the Command Launcher.png "Snapshot_of_the_Command_Launcher.png")

If you are not quite sure about the spelling, just click on the *Fuzzy matching* checkbox:

![](/media/Snapshot of the fuzzy Command Launcher.png "Snapshot_of_the_fuzzy_Command_Launcher.png")

If you want to know what menu the entries are in, or from which .jar files they come, enable the *full information*:

![](/media/Snapshot of full info Command Launcher.png "Snapshot_of_full_info_Command_Launcher.png")
