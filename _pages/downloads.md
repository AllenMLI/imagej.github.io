Here you can [download](https://downloads.imagej.net/ImageJ2-20160205.zip) an
"all platforms" version of ImageJ, without a bundled Java or extra extensions.

{% include notice icon="info" content="Unfortunately, due to the ongoing
transition from Java 6 to Java 8, this download of \"plain ImageJ2\" cannot
currently be updated to the latest Java-8-compatible version. See the
[Java 8](/news/2016-05-10-imagej-howto-java-8-java-6-java-3d) page for
details. For the time being, we recommend
[using the Fiji distribution of ImageJ](/software/fiji/downloads) to stay
current with updates." %}
