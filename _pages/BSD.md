**BSD licenses** are a family of **permissive** [free software](Open_Source) licenses, imposing minimal restrictions on the redistribution of covered software. This is in contrast to {% include wikipedia title='Copyleft' text='copyleft'%} licenses like the [GPL](GPL), which have reciprocity share-alike requirements. The original BSD license was used for its namesake, the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), a Unix-like operating system. The original version has since been revised and its descendants are more properly termed modified BSD licenses.

See the {% include wikipedia title='BSD licenses' text='Wikipedia article on BSD licenses'%} for more information.

{% include license name='Simplified BSD License' shortname='BSD-2' description='The """Simplified BSD""" (or """BSD 2-clause""") license is the simplest BSD license. A licensee of BSD-licensed software can:

{% include license name='Modified BSD License' shortname='BSD-3' description='The """Modified""" or """New BSD""" (or """BSD 3-clause""") license is the same as BSD-2, but with an additional clause prohibiting the names of the authors from being used to endorse or promote products relating to the software.' url='http://choosealicense.com/licenses/bsd-3-clause/' choosealicense='bsd-3-clause' osswatch='modbsd' osi='BSD-3-Clause' %}
