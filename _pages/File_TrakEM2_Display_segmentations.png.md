==TrakEM2 Display Segmentations==

A TrakEM2 Display, showing an example of each type of segmentation: a Pipe (left), a Ball (center ; 4 points), an AreaList (top-right), and a Profile (bottom).

These example segmentations sit over an empty canvas –no images– for clarity. 

The color cues indicate that part of the object is above or in the previous layer (red ) and below or in the next layer (blue).

Color cues may be toggled with ’p’. Yellow is the default color for a segmentation, and here it indicates the part of the object sitting on the current layer.
