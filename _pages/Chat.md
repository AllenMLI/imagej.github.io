[[ImageJ]] community members are often available via a couple of different chat services.

{{Notice | If you have ''image analysis'' questions, it is better to use the [https://forum.image.sc/ Image.sc Forum], rather than chat rooms. Most of ImageJ community's image analysis experts frequent the Image.sc Forum, not live chat rooms.}}

== Gitter ==

The [[wikipedia:Gitter|Gitter]] chat service, while relatively new, is a great way to discuss ''programming'' issues with developers of the [[SciJava]] component collection. All you need is either a [https://github.com/ GitHub] or [https://twitter.com/ Twitter] account. Advantages of Gitter include a nice "21st century" web interface, email notification when participants miss messages, and a full searchable history.
