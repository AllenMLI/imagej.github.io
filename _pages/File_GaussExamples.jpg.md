Shows the result of the four examples for Gaussian convolution. (a) shows a simple Gaussian convolution with sigma=8. (b) shows the same Gaussian convolution but using an OutOfBoundsConstantValue instead. (c) shows the result when convolving part of the image in-place. (d) shows the result when individually convolving 1-dimensional parts on the image.
