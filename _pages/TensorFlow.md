}}[https://www.tensorflow.org/ TensorFlow] is an [[open-source]] software library for [[wikipedia:Artificial intelligence|machine intelligence]].

The [https://github.com/imagej/imagej-tensorflow ImageJ-TensorFlow] project enables TensorFlow to be used from ImageJ commands and scripts. Some ImageJ plugins currently use TensorFlow to classify images according to pre-trained models. Future plugins are planned which will support refining models based on additional training images from ImageJ.
