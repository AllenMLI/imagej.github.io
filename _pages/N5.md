N5 is a library and {% include wikipedia title='Application\_programming\_interface' text='API'%} for storing large chunked n-dimensional tensors, and arbitrary meta-data in a hierarchy of groups similar to {% include wikipedia title='Hierarchical\_Data\_Format' text='HDF5'%}.

The N5 [update site](update_site "wikilink") distributes the N5 libraries so they can be used in ImageJ scripts.

See the [N5 repository](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5) for further details.
