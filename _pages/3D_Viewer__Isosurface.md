## How to work with isosurfaces

You can download example source code for this HowTo [here](3D_Viewer__Example_code "wikilink").

Before reading this HowTo, it may be helpful to read [The relation between Content and Universe](3D_Viewer__Content_Structure "wikilink").

When a `Content` is displayed as an isosurface, its `ContentNode` is of type `MeshGroup`. Since `MeshGroup` offers no additional functionality, than what can done with any `Content`, there is actually no reason under normal circumstances to retrieve a `MeshGroup` (although, it can be done of course).
