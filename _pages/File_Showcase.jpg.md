Examples of various reconstructed multi-view datasets

(a) Maximum intensity projection of wild-type Drosophila third instar larva imaged from 22 views with
10× objective. 3d rendering of the posteriors tips of the Drosophila third instar (b) and second instar (c)
larvae imaged from 8 views with 10× objective. (a-c) The signal comes from autofluorescence of the
larval cuticle. (d) Two perpendicular sections and maximum intensity projection of Drosophila ovariole
stained with rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) to visualize membranes and imaged from 12
views with 40× objective. (e) L3 and L1 larval C. elegans worm stained with DNA dye; imaged and
reconstructed from 8 SPIM views acquired with 40× objective. (f) Sections through single time-point of
6-view, time-lapse recording (40× objective) of C. elegans expressing PH-domain-GFP fusion marking
the membranes of 4 cell stage embryo. The C. elegans images highlight the isotropic resolution of
the reconstructed volumes. (g) Sections through 9.5 days old fixed, wild-type mouse embryo recording
autofluorescence from 19 views with 10× objective. (h) Five planes through fixed zebra fish embryo
labeled with membrane marker and cell division marker imaged from 10 views with 20× objective.
