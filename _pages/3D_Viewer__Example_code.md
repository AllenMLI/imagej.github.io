Below you can find a list of all the example java classes for download,
together with a short description.

* [https://github.com/bene51/3DViewer_Examples/blob/master/src/main/java/examples/Display_Content.java Display_Content.java] Demonstrates how to create a virtual universe and display an image stack as volume rendering, orthoslices, isosurface or surface plot.
* [https://github.com/bene51/3DViewer_Examples/blob/master/src/main/java/examples/Change_Attributes.java Change_Attributes.java] Demonstrates how to change attributes like color or transparency of a Content. Also discusses the meaning of these attributes for various display types.

* [https://github.com/bene51/3DViewer_Examples/blob/master/src/main/java/examples/Apply_Transformation.java Apply_Transformation.java] Demonstrates how to modify the transformation of individual Contents.

* [https://github.com/bene51/3DViewer_Examples/blob/master/src/main/java/examples/Highlight_Points.java Highlight_Points.java] Demonstrates how to create named points for a Content and how to handle those landmark sets.

* [https://github.com/bene51/3DViewer_Examples/blob/master/src/main/java/examples/Movie_Recording.java Movie_Recording.java] Demonstrates how to animate the virtual universe and create a movie which can subsequently be embedded into presentations.

* [https://github.com/bene51/3DViewer_Examples/blob/master/src/main/java/examples/Volume_Rendering.java Volume_Rendering.java] Shows how a VoltexGroup can be retrieved after displaying a stack as a volume rendering, and how the volume can be edited.

* [https://github.com/bene51/3DViewer_Examples/blob/master/src/main/java/examples/Orthoslices_.java Orthoslices_.java] Shows how a OrthoGroup can be retrieved after displaying a stack as orthoslices and how the displayed slices can be changed and hidden.

* [https://github.com/bene51/3DViewer_Examples/blob/master/src/main/java/examples/Surface_Plot.java Surface_Plot.java] Shows how a SurfacePlotGroup can be retrieved after displaying a stack as a surface plot and how to update the displayed slice.

* [https://github.com/bene51/3DViewer_Examples/blob/master/src/main/java/examples/Custom_Surface.java Custom_Surface.java] Shows how to create custom meshes, consisting of triangles, lines, points or quads, and how they are displayed in the universe.

* [https://github.com/bene51/3DViewer_Examples/blob/master/src/main/java/examples/Display_4D.java Display_4D.java] Shows how to load 4D data, visualize and animate in the universe.

* [https://github.com/bene51/3DViewer_Examples/blob/master/src/main/java/examples/Two_Canvasses.java Two_Canvasses.java] Shows how to display one universe in two windows.

* [https://github.com/bene51/3DViewer_Examples/blob/master/src/main/java/examples/Custom_Behavior.java Custom_Behavior.java] Shows how to catch and handle mouse and key events.
