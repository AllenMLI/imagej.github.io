Batch-split-channels-howto.pdf  Short 3-page cheat-sheet...  
This shows how to batch-split every .tif or .lsm image file in a folder into a separate grayscale tif for each channel. Creates subfolder C1 or channel 1 images, subfolder C2 for channel 2 images, etc.  The source of the “Batch_Split_Channels_Tool” in Dukechem update site was: http://dev.mri.cnrs.fr/projects/imagej-macros/wiki/Batch_Split_Channels  That site says to put download in /plugins/tools but only worked for me with Fiji2 in 2019 if put in /macros/toolsets (which is where the Dukechem update site automatically puts it).
