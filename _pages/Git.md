Why do we use Git?
------------------

-   Git is a first-class {% include wikipedia title='Distributed version control' text='distributed'%} {% include wikipedia title='Version control' text='version control'%} system, so we use it to keep a record of changes to avoid loss-of-work and to appropriately explain/document changes as projects develop.
-   Git history, which is composed of "snapshots" of the source code, can be used to go back at any point in time, which leads to reproducible science.

Rewriting history
-----------------

One of the most powerful things Git can do is rewrite a series of patches after the fact. This is a powerful technique worth learning. There are many guides available here and elsewhere:
