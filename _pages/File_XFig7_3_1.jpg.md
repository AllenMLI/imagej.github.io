Segmented masks from cement paste (top left, OPC CEM 1, 42.5, w/c 0.35, 28 days hydration) and from the contact zone of the anode membrane of a solid oxide fuel cell (bottom left).  A virtual 3D reconstrucion was applied to the original structures (center).  A single slice from the 3D image stack is displayed for both cases (right), showing different structures than the original ones, with however closely resembling characteristics.
