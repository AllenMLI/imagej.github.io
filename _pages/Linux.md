Installation
============

Some flavors of Linux make [ImageJ 1.x](ImageJ_1.x ) available as a package. Do not install ImageJ this way—you will not receive [ImageJ2](ImageJ2 ), and you will have problems installing additional plugins. For the time being, it is recommended to [download the Linux 64-bit distribution of Fiji](Fiji/Downloads ).

HiDPI displays
==============

You can make [ImageJ 1.x](ImageJ_1.x ) scale better on HiDPI displays by installing Java 9. See [this forum post](http://forum.imagej.net/t/how-to-increase-the-gui-font-size/552).
