{% include learn content='languages' %} A thin wrapper around [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) is currently available on the {% include list-of-update-sites content='Java 8 update site' %}, providing Scala scripting capabilities in ImageJ. However, support is *very new* and *largely untested*. Support will be improved later, as time allows.
