Another contribution from professional computer vision researchers to Fiji is the [[CMP-BIA_tools|'''JSLIC superpixel''']] algorithm recently contributed by [http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~borovji3/ '''Jiri Borovec'''].

It is brought to you from the [http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/ '''Center for Machine Perception'''] (CMP) which is a university research center performing fundamental and applied research in computer vision, robotics, machine learning, pattern recognition, and mathematics. Jiri is a member of the the [http://www.fel.cvut.cz/vv/tymy/mip.html '''Biomedical Imaging Algorithms group'''] (BIA) headed by '''Jan Kybic''' who develops new algorithms for biomedical image processing. Thus '''CMB-BIA''' tools. 

The CMP-BIA tools is a package for ImageJ/Fiji which will perform image segmentation and registration. For a fast integration of their plugins into Fiji you can use their own {{ListOfUpdateSites|update site}}.

We are exploiting here our Czech connections and are looking forward to many more cool tools coming to Fiji from CMP-BIA.
