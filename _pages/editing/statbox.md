This page explains how the "Vital statistics" sidebar works.

The sidebar supports quite a few fields; see [this comment](https://github.com/imagej/imagej.github.io/blob/main/_includes/layout/statbox#L30-L72) for a list. Including at least one of these fields will cause the statbox to appear; otherwise, there will be no statbox for the page.
