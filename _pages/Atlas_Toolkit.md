These 2D elastic registrations are powered by the [BUnwarpJ](BUnwarpJ "wikilink") plugin, and registration is guided by the gross morphology of the corresponding 3D objects, which can be defined using the [Segmentation Editor](Segmentation_Editor "wikilink") plugin.

## Installation of the plugin

The plugin can be quickly installed via the project's update site. Please refer to the [ **tutorial**](Update_Sites "wikilink") on how to add our update site to your Fiji installation. Our update site has the following URL:

## What's in the toolkit?

Atlas Toolkit includes a number of different tools to help building atlases. Many of these will be of limited use/interest.

For those interested in 3D image registration, the most important tools will be [Label Registration 3D](#Label_Registration_3D "wikilink") and [Apply Label Registration](#Apply_Label_Registration "wikilink").

The complete list of tools is as follows:

  - Extract Nuclear Signal

<!-- end list -->

  - Project to Segment Label

<!-- end list -->

  - [Label Registration 3D](#Label_Registration_3D "wikilink")

<!-- end list -->

  - [Apply Label Registration](#Apply_Label_Registration "wikilink")

<!-- end list -->

  - Merge Registered Volumes

<!-- end list -->

  - Sample Volumes for Clustering

<!-- end list -->

  - Cluster Viewer
