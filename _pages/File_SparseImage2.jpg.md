Shows the result of sparse sampling of an existing image using a varying number of random samples. The upper panel shows the rendering using nearest neighbor interpolation, the lower panel uses an interpolated, distance-weighted value of the k nearest neighbors relative to each sampled location (i.e. each pixel).
