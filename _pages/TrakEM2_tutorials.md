## Video tutorial on the basic recipe for TrakEM2

{% include thumbnail-link src="/images/pages/Screenshot-TrakEM2 basics tutorial.png" title='TrakEM2 basic tutorial' link='TrakEM2 basic tutorial '%}

This is the [basic tutorial for TrakEM2](TrakEM2_basics_tutorial ). **If you are new to TrakEM2, please start by watching [this tutorial](TrakEM2_basics_tutorial )**. It includes:

  - Importing an image stack.
  - Registering stack slices manually, using color overlays and affine transforms.
  - Defining a template tree structure for your segmentations.
  - Segmenting cells across multiple sections.
  - 3D visualization.

## Video tutorial on segmenting/outlining objects over multiple sections in 3D

{% include thumbnail-link src="/images/pages/Arealists-brushing.jpg" title='TrakEM2 brushing (This video tutorial was made by Albert Cardona. To visualize it, you need a mp4 player.)' link='TrakEM2 brushing (This video tutorial was made by Albert Cardona. To visualize it, you need a mp4 player.) '%} This mp4 [video tutorial](http://www.ini.uzh.ch/~acardona/movies/arealist-create-and-edit.mp4) covers:

  - How to use the PEN tool with "area lists" segmentation type (paint an area, flood-fill, erase, flood-erase).
  - How to use ROIs (selections like polygon and freeroi) to edit "area lists".

See also the list of [key bindings for AreaList](http://www.ini.uzh.ch/~acardona/trakem2_manual.html#edit_arealist).

## Video tutorial on aligning sections

{% include thumbnail-link src="/images/pages/Screenshot-TrakEM2 align sections tutorial.png" title='TrakEM2 align sections tutorial' link='TrakEM2 align sections tutorial '%}

[This video tutorial](TrakEM2_align_sections_tutorial ) is focused on:

  - Automatically registering sections.
  - Selecting feature extraction parameters.

See also the feature extraction and alignment [parameters explained](http://www.ini.uzh.ch/~acardona/howto.html#sift_parameters).

## Video tutorial on manual segmentation modes

{% include thumbnail-link src="/images/pages/Screenshot-TrakEM2-Manual-Segmentation-Modes-Tutorial.png" title='TrakEM2 manual segmentation modes' link='TrakEM2 manual segmentation modes '%}

[Tutorial on how to manually segment cells using the 3 segmentation modes](TrakEM2_segmentation_modes_tutorial ):

  - Overlap  
    multiple arealists can coexist in space (the normal mode; arealists are independent).
  - Exclude  
    when painting in an arealist, do not allow paint to occur over any other existing arealist.
  - Erode  
    when painting in an arealist, paint in the current but erase any other arealist.

## Video tutorial on semi-automatic segmentation

{% include thumbnail-link src="/images/pages/Screenshot-TrakEM2-tutorial-automatic-segmentation.png" title='TrakEM2 semi-automatic segmentation' link='TrakEM2 semi-automatic segmentation '%}

In [this video tutorial](TrakEM2_semi-automatic_segmentation_tutorial ) you will learn:

  - How to segment cells by only one click.
  - Fast marching method tool in TrakEM2.
  - Selecting segmentation parameters.

## Video tutorial on measuring surfaces and volumes

{% include thumbnail-link src="/images/pages/Screenshot-TrakEM2-tutorial-measure-surfaces.png" title='TrakEM2 measuring surfaces and volumes' link='TrakEM2 measuring surfaces and volumes '%}

In [this video tutorial](TrakEM2_measurements_tutorial ) you will learn how to:

  - Extract information from TrakEM2 project objects.
  - Save measurements into files.

See also [AreaList measurements](http://www.ini.uzh.ch/~acardona/trakem2_manual.html#measure_arealist) in the TrakEM2 manual, with figures.

## Video tutorial on adding sections/layers to an existing project

{% include thumbnail-link src="/images/pages/Screenshot-TrakEM2-tutorial-add-layers.png" title='TrakEM2 adding layers to existing project' link='TrakEM2 adding layers to existing project '%}

[Here](TrakEM2_add_more_sections/layers_tutorial ) you will learn how to:

  - Open an image sequence as a virtual stack in Fiji.
  - Calibrate the virtual stack.
  - Import the virtual stack into TrakEM2 as a sequence of layers (sections), one image per layer.

In the tutorial, the layers are imported following an existing set of layers, i.e. concatenating to enlarge the collection of sections.
