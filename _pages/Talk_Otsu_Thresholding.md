## Todo

  - Rewrite plugin to handle stacks correctly
  - Rewrite plugin to handle 16-bit images natively

I think that this is superseeded by the Auto Threshold plugin which handles stack slices independently or with a global histogram (including Otsu's method). There is, however no 16 bit version yet.

## Deprecated?

Agree. Like for the MultiThresholder, it should be removed with next relase [JeanYvesTinevez](User_JeanYvesTinevez "wikilink") 17:50, 13 April 2009 (CEST)
