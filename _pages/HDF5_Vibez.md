This plugin is an HDF5 reader/writer plugin for [[ImageJ]] and [[Fiji]]. It is a continuation of the [http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/opensource/imagej_plugins/hdf5.html original code] by Matthias Schlachter, Olaf Ronneberger and Kun Liu.

HDF5 is a data format for storing extremely large and complex data collections. For more information, see the [http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/ official website]. The plugin uses the [https://wiki-bsse.ethz.ch/display/JHDF5 jhdf5 library from ETH SIS] for reading and writing HDF5 files.

For further details, see the {{GitHub | org=fiji | repo=HDF5_Vibez | label=fiji/HDF5_Vibez}} repository on GitHub.
