ImageJ had a Jenkins server: a continuous integration system which automatically checked the code for build and test errors. As of 2019, the [ImageJ](/software/imagej) and [SciJava](/libs/scijava) projects have transitioned to [Travis CI](/develop/travis) and [AppVeyor](/develop/appveyor) for CI services.
