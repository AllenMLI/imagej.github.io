[AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/) is a tool for [continuous integration](/develop/project-management#continuous-integration) on [Windows](/platforms/windows) platforms. It is very useful for automating builds, deployment and other tasks.


# Services

Most [ImageJ](/about) and [SciJava](SciJava) builds use [Travis CI](/develop/travis). However, for Windows-specific builds, AppVeyor is used.

See e.g. the [ImageJ Launcher](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/scijava/imagej-launcher) build.
