The source code of ImageJ is very modular; i.e., it is organized into [well-separated](/develop/architecture#modularity) projects. This separation offers many advantages for efficient software development and it is well worth investing a little bit of time to understand.

## Where is the code?

{% include tip tip='You can search the source code at http://search.imagej.net/ using the GitHub button!' %}\* All source code is on [GitHub](/develop/github).

-   Each project exists in its own GitHub organization.
-   Each organization contains multiple source code repositories.
-   Each repository corresponds to one Java library (.jar file).

See the [Architecture](/develop/architecture) page for more information about the relationship between these projects.

## What is the license?

Most is [BSD-2](/licensing/bsd) (permissive); some is [GPL](/licensing/gpl) (copyleft). See the [Licensing](/licensing) page.

## Building from source

Virtually all of these repositories have a top-level `pom.xml` file, identifying them as [Maven](/develop/maven) projects.

To build a Maven project:

1.  [Install Maven](http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html).
2.  Clone the source repository of interest.
3.  Type `mvn` from the top-level directory.

Advanced instructions for building, or modifying, the source code are available for specific development environments:

{% include develop/ide-links %}

 Note that these tutorials are targeted towards [ImageJ](/about), but would apply to any Maven-based project.

## Javadocs

Javadoc for all ImageJ-related projects can be found online:

{% include big-link url='https://javadoc.scijava.org/' %}

You can also search the javadocs at
[https://search.imagej.net/](https://search.imagej.net/)
using the Javadoc button.

### Running ImageJ1 unit tests

We have written a substantial number of unit tests to exercise [ImageJ 1.x](/software/imagej1) functionality. See the [Unit tests for ImageJ1](/develop/ij1-unit-tests) page for more information.
