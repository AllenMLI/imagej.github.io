Wiki already features `tasks` so it may not be necessary to re-implement a new template for it. Also, other pages would profit from such template. So the name `guidetask` may give the impression that the template is guide specific.

Here is an example of `tasks` in action:

The syntax:

    
{% capture requests%}
Page on new command {% include bc content='File|New Command'%}
{% endcapture %}
{% include tasks requests=requests assess='Accuracy of page ' cleanup='[[BAR]] page needs to be cleaned ' copyedit='[[BAR]] needs copy-editing ' disambiguation='[[BAR]] meaning is unclear ' expand='[[Developer]] ' infobox='An infobox on new items ' maintain='sds ' merge='Include comment X from forum on topic Y ' npov='Neutral point of view task here ' photo='A photo that needs to be included ' split='The article is too long. Split it! ' stubs='This article is a stub ' update='This needs to be updated. ' verify='Someone with skill on FFT should edit this page ' wikify='The page needs to be wikified ' other='Misc task here ' %}

The result:


{% capture requests%}
Page on new command {% include bc content='File|New Command'%}
{% endcapture %}
{% include tasks requests=requests assess='Accuracy of page ' cleanup='[BAR](BAR "wikilink") page needs to be cleaned ' copyedit='[BAR](BAR "wikilink") needs copy-editing ' disambiguation='[BAR](BAR "wikilink") meaning is unclear ' expand='[Developer](Developer "wikilink") ' infobox='An infobox on new items ' maintain='sds ' merge='Include comment X from forum on topic Y ' npov='Neutral point of view task here ' photo='A photo that needs to be included ' split='The article is too long. Split it\! ' stubs='This article is a stub ' update='This needs to be updated. ' verify='Someone with skill on FFT should edit this page ' wikify='The page needs to be wikified ' other='Misc task here ' %}
