Wiki already features <tt>tasks</tt> so it may not be necessary to re-implement a new template for it. Also, other pages would profit from such template. So the name <tt>guidetask</tt> may give the impression that the template is guide specific. 

Here is an example of <tt>tasks</tt> in action:

The syntax:
<pre>
{{tasks
|requests=Page on new command {{Bc|File|New Command}}
|assess= Accuracy of page
|cleanup=[[BAR]] page needs to be cleaned
|copyedit=[[BAR]] needs copy-editing
|disambiguation=[[BAR]] meaning is unclear
|expand=[[Developer]]
|infobox=An infobox on new items
|maintain=sds
|merge= Include comment X from forum on topic Y 
|npov= Neutral point of view task here
|photo=A photo that needs to be included
|split=The article is too long. Split it!
|stubs=This article is a stub
|update=This needs to be updated.
|verify=Someone with skill on FFT should edit this page
|wikify=The page needs to be wikified
|other=Misc task here
}}
</pre>

The result:

{{tasks
|requests=Page on new command {{Bc|File|New Command}}
|assess= Accuracy of page
|cleanup=[[BAR]] page needs to be cleaned
|copyedit=[[BAR]] needs copy-editing
|disambiguation=[[BAR]] meaning is unclear
|expand=[[Developer]]
|infobox=An infobox on new items
|maintain=sds
|merge= Include comment X from forum on topic Y 
|npov= Neutral point of view task here
|photo=A photo that needs to be included
|split=The article is too long. Split it!
|stubs=This article is a stub
|update=This needs to be updated.
|verify=Someone with skill on FFT should edit this page
|wikify=The page needs to be wikified
|other=Misc task here
}}
