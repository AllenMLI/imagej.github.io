ImageJ is an open source Java image processing program inspired by [NIH Image](NIH_Image ). It runs on any computer with a Java 1.8 or later virtual machine. [Downloadable distributions](Downloads ) are available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. ImageJ has a strong, established user base, with thousands of [plugins](plugins ) and [macros](macros ) for performing a wide variety of tasks.

Flavors
-------

There are a few different flavors of ImageJ with very similar names, and some confusion is inevitable. Below is a table which should help to clarify the purpose of each. For the historical context of these projects, see [History](#History "wikilink") below.

History
-------

The first imaging program that {% include person content='Rasband' %} developed, starting in the late 70s, was called simply "Image". It was written in Pascal, ran on PDP-11 minicomputers and ran in only 64KB of memory! Rasband started work on the second, [NIH Image](NIH_Image ), in 1987 when the Mac II became available. Rasband was a Mac enthusiast, and the Mac II had card slots just like the PDP-11. Rasband started work on ImageJ in 1997, when Java was becoming popular. Rasband was intrigued by the idea of creating a version of NIH Image that would "run anywhere", including as an applet in Web browsers.
