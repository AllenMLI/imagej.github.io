== What is the Javadoc? ==
The source code of java programs is "self-documented".<br>
Most classes, methods and attributes are described by some short docstring to explain their purpose. 
This documentation can be visualised as a user-friendly webpage: the Javadoc or API (for Application Programming Interface).

The API is a precious ressource for users and developers willing to develop custom scripts or programs. It lists all available functions for a given class, and give information on what type of parameter they expect and return.

Most scijava-projects API are listed on the [https://javadoc.scijava.org scijava javadocs].
