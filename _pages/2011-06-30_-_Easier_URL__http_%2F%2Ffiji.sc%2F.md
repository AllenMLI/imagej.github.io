The Fiji Wiki now has an easy-to-remember URL: https://fiji.sc/

The original URL, http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/ is still valid, and in fact, the server has not changed, thanks to the continued service offered by the [Max-Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics](http://www.mpi-cbg.de/).

In related news, we added the [Google +1 button](http://www.google.com/+1/button/) to the main page.

As always, [your feedback](mailto_fiji-devel@googlegroups.com) is welcome\!
