Comparison of bead-based and intensity-based multi-view reconstruction on 7-view acquisition of Drosophila embryo expressing His-YFP

(a,b) Maximum projections along the rotation axis highlight the crossing of the axially elongated bead
point spread functions (inset) for (a) bead-based and (b) intensity-based registration. The raw image
data for intensity-based registration were cropped to minimize the volume size. (c-f) Show cut planes
through the registered specimen, where angle 0° is colored magenta and angles 45° (c,d) and 270°
(e,f) are colored green to visualize the overlap of corresponding image content. Perfect overlap results
in gray color. (c,e) shows the result of the bead-based registration while (d,f) shows intensity-based
registration. (g,h) show 3d-renderings of the anterior portion of the embryo, colored as in (c-f). Note the
increased overlap in sample intensities for the bead-based registration (g) compared to the intensity-
based registration (h).
