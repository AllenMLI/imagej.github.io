Schematic drawing of a Selective Plane Illumination Microscope

The specimen embedded in agarose is illuminated by a laser light sheet, the CCD camera behind the
objective is focussed on the center of the light sheet. Optical sectioning is achieved by moving the
sample through the light sheet. Multiple acquisitions of the sample can be taken by rotating the agarose
column. The water in the sample chamber can be cooled by a Peltier device to slow down developmental
processes.
