Export of superpixel segmentation into a text file as segmentation matrix with labels. The first line mark the image dimensions (e.g. Dims: {width} {height}) and then follow the labeling where each image represents  the superpixel index. (Note, number of lines is equal to {image width} and in each line containing {image height} the indexes are splitted by blanc space.)
