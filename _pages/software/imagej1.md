ImageJ 1.x, often shortened to ImageJ1 or IJ1, the original version of [ImageJ](/software/imagej), has been under continuous development since 1997. It has always been, and continues to be, a project of {% include person id='rasband' %}, with the help of many contributers.

ImageJ was originally developed in 1997 as a cross-platform version of [NIH Image](/software/nih-image). ImageJ grew organically over time as {% include person id='rasband' %} continued to add features according to user requests. Now there are many hundreds, probably thousands, of plugins written by members of a diverse community.

The other main flavor of ImageJ is often referred to as [ImageJ2](/software/imagej2), to differentiate it from ImageJ 1.x. The ImageJ2 distribution actually includes the latest version of ImageJ 1.x as well, along with a [backwards compatibility layer](/libs/imagej-legacy), which transparently converts between IJ1 and IJ2 data structures as needed.
