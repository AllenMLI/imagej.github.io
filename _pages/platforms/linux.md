{% include wikipedia title='Linux' text='Linux' %} (also known as {% include wikipedia title='GNU/Linux naming controversy' text='GNU/Linux' %}) is an [open source](Open_source) family of desktop operating systems. It is [the third most common desktop computing platform](https://www.netmarketshare.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx) after [Windows](/platforms/windows) and [macOS](/platforms/macos). This page details issues specific to using [ImageJ](/software/imagej) on Linux systems.

# Installation

Some flavors of Linux make [ImageJ 1.x](/software/imagej1) available as a package. Do not install ImageJ this wayâ€”you will not receive [ImageJ2](/software/imagej2), and you will have problems installing additional plugins. For the time being, it is recommended to [download the Linux 64-bit distribution of Fiji](/software/fiji/downloads).

# HiDPI displays

You can make [ImageJ 1.x](/software/imagej1) scale better on HiDPI displays by installing Java 9. See [this forum post](http://forum.imagej.net/t/how-to-increase-the-gui-font-size/552).
