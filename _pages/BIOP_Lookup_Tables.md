## Purpose

Having LUTs to handle display of images with more than 3 channels. Visit [Color Image Processing](Color_Image_Processing "wikilink") page to know more about LUTs.

## Details

Classical color space are RGB and CMY. Expressed as RGB value, CMY are equal combination of 2 components of RGB, ie Cyan is obtained by combining Green and Blue in equal proportion.

Here, we propose to use 6 LUTs, which are obtained by combining Red Green and Blue, by two, in different proportion.

## On 3 channels image

![3 channels, each in Grays levels. ](/images/pages/3chs Grays cell.jpg "3 channels, each in Grays levels. ")

### RGB

### CMY

## On 4 (to 6) channels image

![4 channels image, each in Grays levels. ](/images/pages/4chs Grays cell.jpg "4 channels image, each in Grays levels. ")

### Appropriate BIOP-LUTs selection

![4 channels image, biop luts good choice](/images/pages/4chs biop-lut cell ok.jpg "4 channels image, biop luts good choice")

### Unappropriate BIOP-LUTs selection

![4 channels image, biop luts poor choice](/images/pages/4chs biop-lut cell bad.jpg "4 channels image, biop luts poor choice")

Here, channels 2 and 3 are tubular structure and it's difficult to distinguish them if both are greenish.

## Macro Language

``` java
run("biop-Amber");
run("biop-Azure");
run("biop-BrightPink");
run("biop-Chartreuse");
run("biop-ElectricIndigo");
run("biop-SpringGreen");
```

## Install

You can either use our PTBIOP update site or [download biop-luts.zip](https://imagej.net/_images/b/b0/Biop-luts.zip) and extract to the \\luts folder.
