The Tubular Geodesics plugins were developed several years ago<ref name="Turetken"></ref> for [[SNT:_FAQ#snt|Simple Neurite Tracer]] but remain functional in modern [[SNT]]. They can be installed manually as an SNT add-on. Once installed, they allow you to trace on a filtered-version of your image in which neuronal processes (or other tubular structures) are significantly enhanced using [[ITK]] segmentation. More details on the following pages:
