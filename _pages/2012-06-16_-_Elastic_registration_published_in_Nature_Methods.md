Stephan Saalfeld's elastic registration algorithm for serial section microscopy was published in [http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nmeth.2072.html Nature Methods] <ref>{{cite journal|author=Stephan Saalfeld, Richard Fetter, Albert Cardona, and Pavel Tomancak|year=Epub ahead of print 10 June 2012|title=Elastic volume reconstruction from series of ultra-thin microscopy sections|journal=Nature Methods|url=http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nmeth.2072.html|doi=10.1038/nmeth.2072}}</ref>. The programs implementing the approach have been already available for some months in Fiji both as a standalone [[Elastic_Alignment_and_Montage|plugin]] and as part of Albert Cardona's [[TrakEM2|TrakEM2]] suite.

The paper is accompanied by a number of spectacular videos visualizing the method, the evaluation and the results for electron microscopy and array tomography section series. Check out the movies [http://fly.mpi-cbg.de/elastic here]. Additionally, you can browse through the reconstructed C. elegans dataset (courtesy of Rick Fetter from the Janelia Farm) with [http://fly.mpi-cbg.de/c-elegans CATMAID].

Congratulations to everyone involved, particularly Stephan!
