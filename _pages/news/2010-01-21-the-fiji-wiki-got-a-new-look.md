title: 2010-01-21 - The Fiji Wiki got a new look
categories: News

Thanks to Alexander Wende and Tim Cross, the Fiji Wiki has a new look and feel (named {% include wikipedia title='Viti Levu' text='"Viti Levu"'%}). {% include person id='iarganda' %} also had a big hand in debugging and enhancing it.

In the same run, it must be mentioned that [Benjamin Schmid](http://www.neurofly.de/) put in a <u>lot</u> of work to make the nice new snapshots happen, by accomodating the new {% include github repo='fiji' path='bin/prepare-wiki-screenshot.py' label='generator script' %} with the 3D viewer's API.

Stephan Saalfeld made the menu work on the iPhone (click/tap on a menu button and the menu will stay open).
