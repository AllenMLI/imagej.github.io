title: 2015-04-24 - A new way to search for ImageJ resources
---

Today, the ImageJ team has launched a unified site for searching ImageJ resources, including web, code, issues, mailing lists and more.

The site is:

<div style="padding-left: 30px; font-size: 24px">

[http://search.imagej.net/](http://search.imagej.net/)

</div>

The source code can be found {% include github org='imagej' repo='imagej-search' %}. Everyone is welcome to contribute any improvements.

We hope this site makes it easier for the community to quickly locate information about ImageJ.
