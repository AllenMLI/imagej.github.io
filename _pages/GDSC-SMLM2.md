GDSC SMLM plugins provide various tools for single molecule localisation analysis.

* Fit an image, or series of images, using a 2D Guassian Point Spread Function (PSF)
* Save results to a table, a file, an image and/or to memory
* Trace or cluster localisations through time to identify molecules
* Correct drift in long time course images
* Estimate fluorophore dark-time and blinking rate
* Create localisation density images
* Create custom PSFs from calibration images
* Create simulated data using a Gaussian or custom PSF with configurable molecule populations and diffusion
* Calibrate the gain and read noise of your microscope camera
* Estimate noise in an image
* Estimate resolution using Fourier Ring Correlation (FRC)
