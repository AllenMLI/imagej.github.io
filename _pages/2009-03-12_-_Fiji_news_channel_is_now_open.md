Fiji now has its own news channel. We will use this feed to post news related to Fiji development and relevant events. Stay tuned\!

If you need to post a news event, simly use the Fiji wiki to do so:

  - Create an article in the wiki
  - For archiving reason, please name it as
        yyyy-mm-dd - news title
    so that items are sorted chronologically in the category.
  - Add the category tag:
        <nowiki>[[Category:News]]</nowiki>
    at the end of the page

That's all\! Enjoy\!
