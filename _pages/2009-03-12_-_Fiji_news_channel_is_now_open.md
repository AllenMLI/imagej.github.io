Fiji now has its own news channel. We will use this feed to post news related to Fiji development and relevant events. Stay tuned!

If you need to post a news event, simly use the Fiji wiki to do so: 
* Create an article in the wiki
* For archiving reason, please name it as <pre>yyyy-mm-dd - news title</pre> so that items are sorted chronologically in the category.
* Add the category tag: <pre><nowiki>[[Category:News]]</nowiki></pre> at the end of the page

That's all! Enjoy!
