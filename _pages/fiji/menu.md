The hierarchy of the Fiji's Menu is shown here, with a few words of explanation for each menu entry and links to more documentation where available. If you know about a menu entry that is in this list, but which doesn't yet have a description, please add it.

This list is generated automatically from a {% include github repo='fiji' path='bin/plugin-list-parser.py' label='script' %} that can be found in the development folder. It is stored in [this template](Template_PluginList).
