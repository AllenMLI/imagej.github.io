[http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/javawebstart/index.jsp Java WebStart] is a means to deploy full Java applications via web, without the need to install anything.

For some time, Fiji provided two WebStart versions:

* stable, which had the same versions of the plugins as the [[Fiji Updater]] would provide, and
* current, which followed the cutting-edge of Fiji's [https://github.com/fiji/fiji source code repository].

Both were updated every night (to be precise, some time after 04:15 central European time).

However, Java WebStart was not used all that often, and after a server meltdown in Dresden the Fiji web server was built back up in Madison, WI, and WebStart was not put back into action as of February 2014.
