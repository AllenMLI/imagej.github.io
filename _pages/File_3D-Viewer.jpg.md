[http://132.187.25.13/home/?category=Download&page=Viewer3D 3D Viewer]: hardware-accelerated 3D visualization of image stacks as volumes, orthoslices and meshes.

Supports 3D text and scale bars.

The above meshes were generated in [http://www.ini.uzh.ch/~acardona/trakem2.html TrakEM2], which seamlessly interacts with the 3D Viewer. They represent secondary neuronal lineages from a <i>Drosophila</i> 3rd instar brain.
