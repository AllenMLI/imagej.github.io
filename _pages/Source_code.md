The source code of ImageJ is very modular; i.e., it is organized into [well-separated](Architecture#Modularity) projects. This separation offers many advantages for efficient software development and it is well worth investing a little bit of time to understand.

Where is the code?
------------------

{% include tip tip='You can search the source code at http://search.imagej.net/ using the GitHub button!' %}\* All source code is on [GitHub](GitHub).

-   Each project exists in its own GitHub organization.
-   Each organization contains multiple source code repositories.
-   Each repository corresponds to one Java library (.jar file).

| <img src="/media/Fiji-icon.png" width="28"/>    | [Fiji](https://github.com/fiji)       | A "batteries-included" distribution of ImageJ                   |

See the [Architecture](Architecture) page for more information about the relationship between these projects.

What is the license?
--------------------

Most is [BSD-2](BSD-2) (permissive); some is [GPL](GPL) (copyleft). See the [Licensing](Licensing) page.

Building from source
--------------------

Virtually all of these repositories have a top-level `pom.xml` file, identifying them as [Maven](Maven) projects.

To build a Maven project:

1.  [Install Maven](http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html).
2.  Clone the source repository of interest.
3.  Type `mvn` from the top-level directory.

Advanced instructions for building, or modifying, the source code are available for specific development environments:

 Note that these tutorials are targeted towards [ImageJ](ImageJ), but would apply to any Maven-based project.

Running ImageJ1 unit tests
--------------------------

We have written a substantial number of unit tests to exercise [ImageJ 1.x](ImageJ_1.x) functionality. See the [Unit tests for ImageJ1](Unit_tests_for_ImageJ1) page for more information.
