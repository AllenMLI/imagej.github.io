| **What**  | In order to launch the new ImageJ website at the highest possible level of quality, we need to do a pass over all the content, [correcting broken syntax](https://github.com/imagej/imagej.github.io/issues/117), [organizing the plugin categories](https://github.com/imagej/imagej.github.io/issues/119), and making notes about any remaining issues. |
| **Why**   | Because there are more than 1400 pages which were mass converted from the old MediaWiki, and there are still rough edges that cannot be fixed automatically. |
| **Who**   | ***We will all do it as a team!*** Please join us&mdash;[sign up here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CdRCMFBXCg6ypDGdDaZNEN5cBY_1Ye47-kyTZQ11wBQ/edit#gid=0) |
| **Where** | We will meet virtually in the [wiki chat room](https://gitter.im/imagej/imagej.github.io) and in a [gather.town space](https://gather.town/app/ipHMoZp6WOdATHE4/FijiHackathon) (for audio/video; still under construction). |
| **When**  | Tuesday, June 1 through Friday, June 4: the first of five **virtual Fiji summer hacking weeks**. Kickoff meeting (attendance optional!) will be Tuesday at 1300 UTC (3pm CEST / 8am CT). |
| **How**   | The [How to help](how-to-help) page has all the details. |

## About gather.town

{% include notice icon='warning' content='The gather.town for next week
  is still under construction! This page will be updated accordingly when it is
  fully ready.' %}

The [I2K 2020 virtual
conference](https://www.janelia.org/you-janelia/conferences/from-images-to-knowledge-with-imagej-friends)
used gather.town to great effect, creating a nice shared virtual space even
though the community could not gather in person. We are doing the same for the
Fiji hacking weeks: this space will provide a place for you to jump in and out
of the effort according to your availability over the course. You have the
option to turn on audio, video, or both while in the town.

Alternately, you are of course also welcome to participate solely
[via chat](https://gitter.im/imagej/imagej.github.io).
But participating in some aspects may not be feasible via text alone; e.g.,
{% include person id='ctrueden' %} will give a video presentation covering
the state of the site some time on Tuesday after the hackathon kickoff, and
it is likely this will be on gather.town.
