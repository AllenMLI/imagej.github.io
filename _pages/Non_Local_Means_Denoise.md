Purpose
=======

This is an ImageJ plugin for denosing images via the non-local-means algorithm descriped in

*Antoni Buades, Bartomeu Coll, and Jean-Michel Morel, Non-Local Means Denoising, Image Processing On Line, vol. 2011.*

including the changes proposed by

*Darbon, J. et al., 2008. Fast nonlocal filtering applied to electron cryomicroscopy. In 2008 5th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro, Proceedings, ISBI. IEEE, pp. 1331–1334.*

It is numerically optimized and multithreaded. It works with all image types (RGB, 32 Bit, 16 Bit, 8 Bit).

This plugin was developed within the scope of a study work of Pascal Behnel and is maintained by Thorsten Wagner (Both are members of the Biomedical Imaging Group).

Settings
========

**Sigma:** The sigma of the noise.

**Smoothing factor:** In most cases, the default value (1) should not be changed. However, sometimes a more smoothed image is desired which can be achieved by selecting values &gt; 1.

**Auto estimate sigma:** If this option is selected, the sigma is automatically estimated by the method descriped in *Immerkaer, J., 1996. Fast noise variance estimation. Computer Vision and Image Understanding.*

Both, the value for the (estimated) sigma and the smoothing factor are saved in the imagej preferences and are accessible with the keys "nlmean.sigma" / "nlmeans.smoothingfactor".

Example
=======

The left image shows a noisy (sigma=25) image of lena and right image the denoised version using the non local means plugin: <img src="/images/pages/Lena-noise-25.png" width="250"/> <img src="/images/pages/Lena-denoised.png" width="250"/>

Installation
============

You could simply use our update site "[biomedgroup](https://fiji.sc/List_of_update_sites)" to install the non local means plugin or copy the jar file into your plugins folder.

How to cite
===========

We think the best way is to cite the formal method and the used implementation:

**Method:**

*Antoni Buades, Bartomeu Coll, and Jean-Michel Morel, Non-Local Means Denoising, Image Processing On Line, vol. 2011.*

and

*Darbon, J. et al., 2008. Fast nonlocal filtering applied to electron cryomicroscopy. In 2008 5th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro, Proceedings, ISBI. IEEE, pp. 1331–1334.*
