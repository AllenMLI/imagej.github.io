Analysis of the registration error

(a) shows the stability of minimal, average and maximal registration error of all registered views in a
time-lapse acquisition. (b) shows a histogram of the remaining displacement between all true corre-
sponding bead pairs after the global optimization. (c) shows histograms of the remaining displacement
between all true corresponding bead pairs in coordinates of the individual original views (i.e. the final
global coordinates from the optimization were transformed back into the coordinate systems of the in-
dividual views). The three histograms show the error distribution separately for each dimension. The
x-dimension is parallel to the rotation axis and therefore shows the lowest error while the z-dimension
shows the highest error reflecting less accurate localization of the beads in the axial direction. The
y -dimension shows intermediate error variation because it is angle-dependent. (d) shows the depen-
dence of the error variance on the angular difference between the views. Note that the angle dependent
error changes mainly in the y -dimension; the smaller the angle difference the lower the average dis-
placement.
