{% include component-stats content='sc.fiji:LSM\_Toolbox' %}The LSM Toolbox provides plugins for working with Carl Zeiss LSM510 .lsm files.

Usage
-----

The LSM Toolbox project aims at the integration of common useful functions around the Zeiss lsm file format, that should enhance usability of confocal lsm files kept in their native format, thus preserving all available metadata.

In Fiji, corresponding commands are:

-   {% include bc content='File | Import | Show LSMToolbox'%} which displays the toolbox, from which all commands can be called;
-   {% include bc content='Help | About Plugins | LSMToolbox...'%} which displays information about the plugin.

For more info see [LSM ToolBox documentation on ImageJ documentation Wiki](http://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/doku.php?id=plugin:inputoutput:lsmtoolbox:start).
