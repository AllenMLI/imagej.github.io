# Introduction

This tutorial assumes that you've already traced an image with Simple Neurite Tracer (SNT) and that you are familiar with the [variants of Sholl methods](Sholl_Analysis#MethodsTable "wikilink") and the [Sholl Analysis](Sholl_Analysis "wikilink") plugin. This tutorial will use an olfactory projection fibre image, freely available from the [Diadem challenge data set](http://www.diademchallenge.org/olfactory_projection_fibers_readme.html).

# Retrieving Profiles

When you've loaded the traces, that should look something like this: ![](Simple_Neurite_Tracer-_Sholl_analysis-1.jpg)

Now you have to pick a centre point for the analysis. This might be the soma or a [relevant focal point](http_//forum.imagej.net/t/sholl-analysis-validation-parameters/3065/2). The centre point must be on one of your existing paths. First, select the path on which your centre point lies_ ![](Simple_Neurite_Tracer-_Sholl_analysis-2.jpg)

Now hold down {% include key content='Ctrl' %}+{% include key content='Shift' %} (on Windows or Linux) or {% include key content='Alt' %}+{% include key content='Shift' %} (on Mac) and move the mouse along the path. A red cross-hair should track along the path_ ![](Simple_Neurite_Tracer-_Sholl_analysis-3.jpg)

... when you've got the red cross-hairs at a suitable point, <i>still</i> holding down {% include key content='Ctrl' %} / {% include key content='Alt' %} and {% include key content='Shift' %}, press the {% include key content='A' %} key. Then you can release the other keys. You should see the Sholl analysis interface appear like this_ ![](Simple_Neurite_Tracer-_Sholl_analysis-4.jpg)

Consider the first two options_ you should probably select the top option *Use all N paths in analysis?* unless you're only wanting to include a subset of the paths, for example if your image stack contains multiple separate neurons. Next you can click on *Plot Profile* so that you can visualize how the intersections with concentric spheres vary with distance from your centre point_ ![](Simple_Neurite_Tracer-_Sholl_analysis-6.jpg)

This graph shows exactly how many times a sphere of a particular radius will intersect with paths (i.e., *continuos sampling*). To consider spheres of evenly spaced radii (see definition of [Step size](Sholl_Analysis#StepSize "wikilink")), you have to enter a value into the *Radius step size* box. E.g., ![](Simple_Neurite_Tracer-_Sholl_analysis-7.jpg)

# Data Normalization

If you need to preview the effect of [normalizing](Sholl_Analysis#MethodsTable "wikilink") the number of intersections by the volume (or area) enclosed by the sphere (or circle) - you can do that by selecting the *Normalize for volume enclosed by circle* option: ![](Simple_Neurite_Tracer-_Sholl_analysis-8.jpg)

The *Use standard axes* / *Use semi-log axes* / *Use log-log axes* controls whether the analysis is based on the log of normalized intersections and distance (*log-log*), the log of normalized intersections (*semi-log*) or unmodified values (linear axes) (see [Sholl Plots](Sholl_Analysis#Sholl_Plots "wikilink") for details. Note that the [Regression coefficient](Sholl_Analysis#ShollDecay "wikilink") is always calculated in real time even if no normalization options are chosen.

# Exporting Profiles

You can export profiles by clicking on "Save Profile" which will prompt for a CSV filename to save to. If you want to export the profile, so that you can edit in some other software or include it in a presentation, you can select *Export graph as SVG* in the graph window. You can then load the SVG file (e.g., in Inkscape):

# Analyzing Profiles

Press *Analyze Profile* to run the [Sholl Analysis](Sholl_Analysis "wikilink") plugin. Once [Parameters](Sholl_Analysis#Parameters "wikilink") have been specified, the plugin will [automatically calculate](Sholl_Analysis#Dratio "wikilink") the normalization method thought to be the most informative. Metrics will be displayed in a [detailed table](Sholl_Analysis#Metrics "wikilink"). {% include tip tip='You can perform batch analysis using [\_\_\_SHADOW1\_\_\_](Sholl_Analysis#Analysis_of_Existing_Profiles "wikilink") or [\_\_\_SHADOW2\_\_\_](Sholl_Analysis#Analysis_of_Traced_Cells "wikilink") ' %}

# Sholl Image

Another option that might be useful is *Make Sholl image*, equivalent to the [Intersections mask](Sholl#Output_Options "wikilink") created by the [Sholl Analysis](Sholl_Analysis "wikilink") plugin when parsing images directly. This will produce a stack which shows the number of intersections at each distance from the centre point on a colour scale. You can see the exact number of intersections corresponding to a colour by mousing over that region and looking in the status bar. For example, this shows you that the orange colour corresponds to 2 intersections ("value=2"): ![](Simple_Neurite_Tracer-_Sholl_analysis-12.jpg)

If you go back to the main tracer interface, keeping that *Sholl image stack* open, you can visualize those colours on the traces by switching the *Use colors / labels from* option to *Sholl analysis of all paths* (volume of original image made transparent for clarity)_ ![](Simple_Neurite_Tracer-_Sholl_analysis-13.jpg)
