## Purpose

This plugin does basically the same things as the [Colour merge](Colour_merge "wikilink") plugin, but allow to merge 4 images or stacks at a time.

This plugin has been edited to include the option for users to pre-subtract a fraction of the fluorescence channel from the grey channel prior to merging. This can prevent a 'washed out' look to the fluorescence.
