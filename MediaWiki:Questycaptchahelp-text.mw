Web sites that accept contributions from the public, like this wiki, are often abused by spammers who use automated tools to add their links to many sites.
While these spam links can be removed, doing so would consume a significant amount of itme.

To protect against spam accounts and links, the wiki may ask you to answer a question. These questions are intended to be easy to answer after brief investigation.
Since answering these questions is hard to automate, it allows most real humans to make their contributions while stopping most spammers and other robotic attackers.

Please contact us via [http://forum.imagej.net/ the ImageJ forum], or any [[Help]] method, for assistance if these questions are unintentionally preventing you from making legitimate contributions.
