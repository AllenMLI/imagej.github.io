== What is Fiji ==

Think of [http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/ ImageJ] as the core of Fiji, which is enhanced by a set of plugins in a coherent menu structure, and comprehensive documentation.

Fiji is a project aiming at simplifying
* the installation of ImageJ
* the usage of ImageJ 
* the usage of specific, powerful ImageJ plugins
* the development of plugins using ImageJ

It is an Open Source project, so everybody is welcome to contribute with plugins, patches, bug reports or "Well done" mails.

== Downloads ==

At the moment, we support

* Linux (x86),
* Linux (amd64),
* MacOSX (PowerPC),
* MacOSX (Intel),
* Windows (x86), and
* Windows (amd64)

All available at the '''[[Downloads|downloads page]]'''.

== Reporting Problems ==

We are delighted to hear about something that does not work, for our goal is to fix it. Seeing the number of different platforms we support, it would be awkward to expect everything working smooth in a snap. So please help us, by complaining about bugs. You can [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/bugzilla/ report them here] and view the list of [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/cgi-bin/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?query_format=specific&order=relevance+desc&bug_status=__open__&product=&content= unresolved problems here].

Thrilled by the project? Hoping it will support your need? Because of its structure and goals, the Fiji project can use the help of a very large range of competence. If you feel like helping (anyone can), you will find our recently assembled task list [[TaskList|here]]. We also just opened a [[Developers HowTo]].
