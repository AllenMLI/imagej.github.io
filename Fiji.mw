== What is Fiji ==

Think of [http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/ ImageJ] as the core of Fiji, which is enhanced by a set of plugins in a coherent menu structure, and comprehensive documentation.

Fiji is a project aiming at simplifying
* the installation of ImageJ
* the usage of ImageJ and some selected powerful plugins
* the development of plugins using ImageJ

It is an Open Source project, so everybody is welcome to contribute with plugins, patches, bug reports or "Well done" mails.

We are delighted to hear about something that does not work, for our goal is to fix it.
