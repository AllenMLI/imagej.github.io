<big>Welcome to '''Fiji'''</big>

The whole purpose of Fiji is to make installation of Java, ImageJ and several plugins easy.  The main focus is neuroscience, but it is hoped that Fiji proves useful to a wide range of users.

At the moment, we support

* Linux (x86),
* Linux (amd64),
* MacOSX (PowerPC),
* MacOSX (Intel),
* Windows (x86), and
* Windows (amd64)

You can download them [[Downloads|here]].
