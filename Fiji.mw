[[About|Fiji]] is an image processing package. It can be described as a distribution of [[ImageJ]] (and [[ImageJ2]]) together with Java, Java3D and a lot of [[plugins]] organized into a [[Plugins Menu|coherent menu structure]]. Fiji compares to ImageJ as Ubuntu compares to Linux.

The main focus of Fiji is to assist research in life sciences.

For [[Fiji Usage|users]], Fiji is [[Downloads|easy to install]] and has an automatic update function, bundles a [[:Category:Plugins|lot of plugins]] and offers comprehensive [[documentation]].

For [[Developing_Fiji|developers]], Fiji is an open source project hosted in a [[Git for dummies|Git version control]] {{GitHub|repo=fiji|label=repository}}, with access to the source code of all internals, libraries and plugins, and eases the [[Development|development]] and [[Scripting Help|scripting]] of plugins.
