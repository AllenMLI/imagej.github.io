[http://bigwww.epfl.ch/sage/soft/mij/ MIJ] is a java package to exchange images between Matlab and ImageJ. It is written by Daniel Sage (Biomedical Image Group (BIG), Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland) and Dimiter Prodanov (Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Université Catholique de Louvain (UCL), Brussels, Belgium). It allows to start a instance of ImageJ inside Matlab and exchange images back and forth with it. It takes advantage of the fact that the user interface of Matlab is written in Java. 

For your convenience, Jacques Pecreaux & Johannes Schindelin wrote Miji.m, which makes it super-easy to use Fiji and the libraries and functions provided by [[Fiji]]'s components from within Matlab. Simply make sure that the ''scripts/'' directory of your ''Fiji.app/'' is in Matlab's search patch, via ''File>Set Path...''. Then a simple

<source lang="matlab">
Miji;
</source>

will start a Fiji inside Matlab.

= Getting started =

An example how to work with MIJ is provided here:

<source lang="matlab">
MIJ.run('Embryos (42K)');
I = MIJ.getCurrentImage;
E = imadjust(wiener2(im2double(I(:,:,1))));
imshow(E);
MIJ.createImage('result',E);
</source>

If you get an error saying that some Plugin related classes cannot be found, please update your Fiji with ''Help>Update Fiji''!

= Getting help =

To get a quick help on the available functions, call

<source lang="matlab">
MIJ.help
</source>

Further descriptions and example code can be found on [http://bigwww.epfl.ch/sage/soft/mij/ the home page for MIJ]. Eventually, detailed documentation about the class MIJ can be found [http://bigwww.epfl.ch/sage/soft/mij/doc/index.html here] (suitable if you have a bit of experience with Java).

= Alternative: do not start the Fiji GUI =

If you want to use the functions without starting Fiji's graphical interface, just call

<source lang="matlab">
Miji(false);
</source>
