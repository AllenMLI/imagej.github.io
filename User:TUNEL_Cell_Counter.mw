== Description ==
The TUNEL Cell Counter is a custom-built and validated ImageJ macro that processes digital images from retinal TUNEL assay.
It segments retinal outer nuclear (ONL) and inner nuclear layers (INL) and quantitates TUNEL+ cells in these layers.


== Macro Features ==
=== Output Variables ===
When executed as a macro, the output variables are:
*ONL Area (mm2)
*ONL Total Cells (count)
*ONL TUNEL+ Cells (count)
*Ratio TUNEL+ Cells/ONL Area (count/mm2)
*Percentage TUNEL+ Cells/ONL Total Cells (%)

*INL Area (mm2)
*INL Total Cells (count)
*INL TUNEL+ Cells (count)
*Ratio TUNEL+ Cells/INL Area (count/mm2)
*Percentage TUNEL+ Cells/INL Total Cells (%)

== Version History ==

v2.0: After a lot of mistakes and problems, each method now propose to generate an orientation map, which colors the image according to the local directionality.
v1.2: Added a new analysis method based on local gradient orientation.
v1.1: Added an option to export the histogram as a table.
v1.0: First working commit with the Fourier method.
