== Description ==
The TUNEL Cell Counter is a custom-built and validated ImageJ macro that processes digital images from retinal TUNEL assay.
It segments retinal outer nuclear (ONL) and inner nuclear layers (INL) and quantitates TUNEL+ cells in these layers.


== Macro Features ==
=== Output Variables ===
When executed as a macro, the output variables are:
*ONL Area (mm2)
*ONL Total Cells (count)
*ONL TUNEL+ Cells (count)
*Ratio TUNEL+ Cells/ONL Area (count/mm2)
*Percentage TUNEL+ Cells/ONL Total Cells (%)

*INL Area (mm2)
*INL Total Cells (count)
*INL TUNEL+ Cells (count)
*Ratio TUNEL+ Cells/INL Area (count/mm2)
*Percentage TUNEL+ Cells/INL Total Cells (%)
