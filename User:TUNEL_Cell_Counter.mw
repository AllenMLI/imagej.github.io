'''TUNEL Cell Counter''' is a free, open source plugin created for ImageJ 2 and FIJI, developed by Daniel E. Maidana, M.D. and Demetrios G. Vavvas, M.D., Ph.D. at the Angiogenesis Laboratory, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Harvard Medical School. TUNEL Cell Counter has been validated for retinal TUNEL assay quantitation in cryo-sections. TUNEL Cell Counter is able to analyze digital images obtained from fluorescent microscopes, segment the outer nuclear (ONL) and inner nuclear layer (INL), and count TUNEL<sup>+</sup> cell in each layer. After analysis, TUNEL Cell Counter generates an array of outcome variables and a merged image with the segmented layers and quantitated cells, to control for macro performance. 
__TOC__

== Overview ==
TUNEL Cell Counter is a custom-built and validated ImageJ macro that processes digital images from retinal TUNEL assay. It segments retinal outer nuclear (ONL) and inner nuclear layers (INL) and quantitates TUNEL+ cells in these layers.

== Download & Install ==
=== TUNEL Cell Counter Macro ===
Download and install the macro:<br>
:Go to ''Plugins > Macros > Install'' and select the downloaded '''.ijm''' file.

=== Dataset Samples === 
The original ONL and INL image datasets used for validation purposes are available to download. We '''strongly''' recommend to download and revise these images in order to have an idea about acquisition and post-processing parameters.

== Version History ==

v2.0: After a lot of mistakes and problems, each method now propose to generate an orientation map, which colors the image according to the local directionality.
v1.2: Added a new analysis method based on local gradient orientation.
v1.1: Added an option to export the histogram as a table.
v1.0: First working commit with the Fourier method.
