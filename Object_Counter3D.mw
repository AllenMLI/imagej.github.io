The Object_Counter3D.java linked in the info box here is by Jonathan Jackson. It is a follow-up of Fabrice Cordelières's  [http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/track/_3D_objects_counter.class _3D_objects_counter.class], [http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/track/_3D_objects_counter.java _3D_objects_counter.java] and its changelog is located on the same website (see infobox).

Newest version (2007?) of the _3D_Objects_Counter.java is available from here: [http://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=plugin:analysis:3d_object_counter:3d-oc_.jar 3d-oc_.jar] whioch if unzipped contains the source code .java files. 

Testing of both versions in fiji showed them both to work. Now need to figure out which one to include. They are indeed slightly different, and do give different results for a 4 slice smoothed random image z stack. 
The  older Jackson version was pushed to contrib branch late june 2009 (how ironic). Pushing both versions doesn't make sense. Both seem to have advanteages, but both are about the same speed as tested with small and large z stacks.
