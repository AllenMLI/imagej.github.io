== Introduction ==
These two plugins from Bob Dougherty are used together to firstly generate an image-stack of the point-spread function (PSF). The second plugin uses this PSF image stack along with your sample-stack with the Iterative Deconvolution 3D plugin. The image below is a single slice taken from a stack before and after deconvolution using these plugins.

== Generating a PSF image stack ==
Run the Diffraction PSF 3D plugin. A dialog will appear. Most of these are self explanatory. The width, height and depth values are for the PSF image, not your image stack. The correct values will need to be empirically determined.

== Iterative deconvolution ==
Run the Iterative Deconvolve 3D plugin. Select the image and PSF stack. Start with the default values. Set iterations to equal 10 initially.
