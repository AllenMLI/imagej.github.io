=How to add an update site to your ImageJ installation=

This tutorial will explain how to '''add an update site to your install of ImageJ''' such that the plugins maintained there will be installed and updated just like normal ImageJ plugins.

In this tutorial we'll be adding plugins from the distribution site at genomics.lbl.gov/~gavin/FijiPlugins.

== Start the [[Updater]] ==

First, start the [[updater]]:

== Add update sites ==

Click on the ''Manage update sites'' button to bring up the site management dialog:

If the update site you want to follow is listed, just click the checkbox next to its name. If it is not listed, you can add Click the ''Add'' button and fill in the name of your choice for the site and the URL, which would be provided by the plugin's author or distributor.

'''Note:''' the list of update sites shown by default is the one you can view and edit [[List of update sites|here]]. Feel free to encourage update site maintainers to [http://imagej.net/List_of_update_sites?action=edit add] their update sites.

Close the dialog and the list of plugins available on the site will show up:

== Choose and download plugins ==

You can select whether you want to install a particular plugin by changing the choice in the status/action column. In this case, there's only one plugin available (including a required jar file), so we're going to install all files. Click on 'Apply Changes' and the updates will be installed:

== Verify install ==

Restart ImageJ as instructed to finish the install. Check to see that the plugin works:

...and that's all there is to it.
