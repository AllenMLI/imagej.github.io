=How to add an update site to your Fiji installation=

This tutorial will explain how to add an ''update site'' (also known as ''plugin distribution site'') to your install of Fiji such that the plugins maintained there will be installed and updated just like normal Fiji plugins.

In this tutorial we'll be adding plugins from the distribution site at genomics.lbl.gov/~gavin/FijiPlugins.

== Start the [[Fiji Updater]] ==

First, start the [[Fiji Updater|updater]]:

== Add update sites ==

Click on the 'Manage update sites' button to bring up the site management dialog:

If the update site you want to follow is listed, just click the checkbox next to its name. If it is not listed, you can add Click the 'Add' button and fill in the name of your choice for the site and the url, which would be provided by the plugin's author or distributor. Note: it might be better for you or the update site owner to add the information to the [[List of update sites]] to make it easier to add.

Close the dialog and the list of plugins available on the site will show up:

== Choose and download plugins ==

You can select whether you want to install a particular plugin by changing the choice in the status/action column. In this case, there's only one plugin available (including a required jar file), so we're going to install all files. Click on 'Apply Changes' and the updates will be installed:

== Verify install ==

Restart Fiji as instructed to finish the install. Check to see that the plugin works:

...and that's all there is to it.
