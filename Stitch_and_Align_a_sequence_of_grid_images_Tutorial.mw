==Introduction==
This tutorial describes how to produce an image stack (or 3D image) from an input sequence of tiles.

As premise, we assume that:
* all the images are stored in the same folder and have an intuitive and numerical name (more information below), and 
* every section of the stack is formed by a squared grid of a predefined size (NxM tiles). 

In our test case, we have 19,600 images, i.e. 140 sections of 10x14 tiles.

==Stitching==
First of all, we start Fiji and go to '''Plugins > Stitching > Stitch Sequence of Grids of Images''':

Then, the next dialog pops up to choose the stitching parameters:

Here, we have to set some important parameters (the ones we don't mention can be left with their default values):

* '''Grid size in X, Y and Z''': number of tiles per column, row and section. In our case: 10, 14 and 140.
* The '''input directory''': the folder containing the image sequence. Notice here that you can drag and drop the folder into the text box and the path will be copied.
* The '''file names''': the template of the file names. The Stitching plugin accept two types of templates, one with a specific number for each x, y or z position, and one with an absolute number (i). In this case, our files will have the template ''Tile_Z{zzz}_Y{yyy}_X{xxx}.png''. That means the file corresponding to the first section, first column, first row, will be called ''Tile_Z{001}_Y{001}_X{001}.png''.
* The '''output directory''': the folder to store the resulting stitched images.
* The '''fusion method''': the way the plugin will treat the overlapping areas. In our test case we won't fusion the images, so we select ''None''.
* The '''regression threshold''': the number below with the plugin won't accept correlation values as valid. The default value (0.3) is quite low, but in our test case works perfect.

We then click on OK and the stitching will take place. The plugin will display all intermediate results until the whole sequence has been stitched.

As result, the stitched images are stored in the output folder:
