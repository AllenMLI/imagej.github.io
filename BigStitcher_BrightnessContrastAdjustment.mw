== Overview ==

Even after correcting for fixed-pattern noise (see [[BigStitcher_Flatfield_correction|here]]), differences in brightness and contrast between images, e.g. due to bleaching, might persist and be visible in the fused images. To correct for this, we estimate optimal linear transforms of pixel intensities in adjacent images to achieve uniform brightness and contrast in the whole dataset. We minimize the intensity difference of all pixels in the overlapping volume of two images according to the current registrations via a linear transform for each image:
''I&prime;''(x) = ''I''(x) * ''&alpha;'' + ''&beta;''


The brightness and contrast adjustment is available in '''Multiview mode''' under {{bc|Processing|Intensity Adjustment}}.

{{Notice|Calculating the intensity adjustment requires the images to be aligned, therefore use it as a last step after registration before fusing the dataset.}}

=== Usage ===

Clicking '''Compute...''' in the Intensity adjustment menu brings up the following dialog:

First, since the adjustment is calculates for pixel intensities in overlapping areas of the images, you can select how to load the pixels:

*'''Bounding Box''' specifies the area to load for the calculation. We will automatically determine overlapping areas in it. Note that the intensity adjustment can not be calculated for images not in the bounding box.
*'''Downsampling''' By how much to downsample the images for the calculation. Since in this step we are only interested in larger-scale intensity variations, we recommend to downsample a lot.
*'''Max inliers''' How much pixels to consider at most for each image pair. 



==== Displaying ====

Clicking '''List all''' in the intensity adjustment sub-menu will list the current intensity adjustment for each image in the dataset.

==== Removing ====

Clicking '''Remove''' in the sub-menu will remove the intensity adjustment from the currently selected image(s).
