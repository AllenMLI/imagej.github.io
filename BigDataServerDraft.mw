__TOC__

== Description ==
BigDataServer is a minimalistic HTTP server that serves XML/HDF5 datasets to the [[BigDataViewer]] Fiji plugin for visualisation.

The BigDataServer is running on a remote machine which hosts the XML/HDF5 datasets.
A client running Fiji connects to the server, chooses the dataset that the server offers and then the data are efficiently delivered to the BigDataViewer.
In this way, it is possible to seamlessly navigate very large datasets that reside in a remote location.


== Installing and running the BigDataServer ==
BigDataServer is packaged as a single "batteries-included" jar file with all required dependencies.
It is run from the command line using Java 7 or higher.
Copy [http://fly.mpi-cbg.de/~pietzsch/bigdataserver.jar bigdataserver.jar] onto your webserver (probably running Linux).
Run the BigDataServer using this command:

 $ java -Xmx4G -jar bigdataserver.jar PARAMETERS

The <tt style="font-size: 1.25em;">-Xmx4G</tt> option gives the server 4GB of RAM.
The server is built on the same caching architecture as BigDataViewer and does not require a lot of RAM to run (1GB or less should be sufficient).
However, running with more RAM means that more of the data can be cached in RAM (on the server).
This will improve performance, because client requests can be handled rapidly from cached data.

Running the above command without parameters will print this help:

 $ java -Xmx4G -jar bigdataserver.jar
 usage: BigDataServer [OPTIONS] [NAME XML] ...
 
 Serves one or more XML/HDF5 datasets for remote access over HTTP.
 Provide (NAME XML) pairs on the command line or in a dataset file, where
 NAME is the name under which the dataset should be made accessible and XML
 is the path to the XML file of the dataset.
 -d <FILE>           Dataset file: A plain text file specifying one dataset
                     per line. Each line is formatted as "NAME <TAB> XML".
 -m                  Enable statistics and manager context.
 -mp <SECURE_PORT>   Manager context HTTPS port.
                     (default: 8443)
 -p <PORT>           Listening port.
                     (default: 8080)
 -s <HOSTNAME>       Hostname of the server.
                     (default: localhost)
 -t <DIRECTORY>      Directory to store thumbnails. (new temporary directory
                     by default.)

A typical command to start the server will look like this:

 $ java -Xmx4G -jar bigdataserver.jar -d datasets.txt -s fly.mpi-cbg.de -p 8081
 2015-02-14 14:02:52.696:INFO::main: Logging initialized @421ms
 ...
 2015-02-14 14:03:12.316:INFO:oejs.Server:main: Started @20046ms

where ''dataset.txt'' is a TAB delimited list of names and XML paths to the locally accessible datasets (comprising the XML and HDF5 files). Optionally, users can add [Category], [Description], [Priority] after the XML path.
For example ''dataset.txt'' could look like this:

 drosophila_original_test	/mnt/export/hdf5_dataset.xml
 drosophila_registered_test	/mnt/export/registered_dataset.xml	drosophila	This experiment set is registered.	1

When the manager context is enabled, the keystore password and manager password should be provided. Those prompts appear when the server starts. If the server starts at the first time, it will create the keystore.jks (for HTTPS connection) and realm.properties (for accessing the manager context) containing the manager's password that the user provide. Whenever the server process starts, it will ask the keystore password to open the keystore.jks.

The server will keep running until you cancel it with {{key press|Ctrl|C}} or close the shell.
To start the server in the background run it in a screen session:

 $ screen
 $ java -Xmx4G -jar bigdataserver.jar -d datasets.txt
 2015-02-14 14:02:52.696:INFO::main: Logging initialized @421ms
 ...
 2015-02-14 14:03:12.316:INFO:oejs.Server:main: Started @20046ms

and detach the screen with {{key press|Ctrl|A}} {{key press|D}}.

To add new datasets edit the ''dataset.txt'' and add new XML paths.
After that you have to currently restart the server.
(Re-attach the screen session with <tt style="font-size: 1.25em;">screen -r</tt>, cancel the server with {{key press|Ctrl|C}} and repeat the above).

Note that the server port needs to be open.


== Connecting to a running BigDataServer from Fiji ==

In order to connect to a BigDataServer from Fiji and view the data go to {{bc | Plugins | BigDataViewer | Browse BigDataServer}}.
You will be presented with the following dialog box:

[[Image:bdv-browse-bigdataserver-1.png|500px]]

Enter the URL (including port) of a BigDataServer.
For example, the Drosophila timelapse dataset described in 
[[BigDataViewer_Example_Datasets#Remote_HDF5]] is available through this address:
[http://fly.mpi-cbg.de:8081 http://fly.mpi-cbg.de:8081]. Click OK.
The following window will pop up showing a list of datasets offered by the server:

[[Image:bdv-browse-bigdataserver-2.png|500px]]

In the example, the server offers only a single dataset called ''Drosophila''.
Double-clicking on a dataset in the list will launch it in the BigDataViewer.
