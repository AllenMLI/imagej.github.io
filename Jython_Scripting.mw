== The Jython interpreter plugin ==

The interpreter provides a screen and a prompt. Type any jython code on the prompt to interact with ImageJ.

Launch it from plugins - Scripting - Jython Interpreter. See [[Scripting Help]] for all keybindings, and also [[Scripting comparisons]].

Within the interpreter, all ImageJ, java.lang.* and TrakEM2 classes are automatically imported. So creating new images and manipulating them is very straighforward.


=== Language basics ===

* Any text after a # is commented out.
* There are no line terminators (such as ';' in other languages), neither curly braces to define code blocks.
* Indentation defines code blocks.
* Functions are defined with <i>def</i>, and classes with <i>class</i>.
* Functions are objects, and thus storable in variables.
* Jython (and python in general) accepts a mixture of procedural and object-oriented code.
* Jython currently implements the Python language at its 2.5 version. All [http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/ documentation for python 2.5] applies to Jython bundled with Fiji (with the remarks listed later).


=== Workflow for creating Jython scripts === 

The recommended setup is the following:

* Edit a file in your favorite text editor, and save it with an underscore in the name and a .py extension anywhere under ImageJ plugins folder.
* Run ''Plugins>Scripting>Refresh Jython scripts'' <b>only</b> the very first time after newly creating the file under any folder or subfolder of ImageJ's plugins folder. A menu item will appear with its name, from which it can be run.
* Keep editing (and saving) the file from your editor. Just select the menu item to execute it over and over. Or use the ''Plugins>Utilities>Find Commands...'' window to launch it easily (keybinding 'l').

The next time Fiji is run, it will setup all your scripts in the Plugins menu.

=== Some limitations of jython === 

Though jython tries to be as close as possible as python, there are some differences you may experience during scripting.

* <u>Float "special numbers" such as ''NaN'' and ''Inf'' are not handled.</u>
For instance, 
<source lang="python"> a = float('nan') </source>
will create the correct float number in python, but will throw an exception in jython.

Instead, to create a NaN in jython, use:
<source lang="python">
>>> a = Double.NaN
>>> print a
NaN 
</source>
To test if a number is NaN:
<source lang="python">
>>> if Double.isNaN(a):
        print "a is NaN!"
a is NaN! 
</source>

* <u>Some existing python modules can't be imported in jython.</u>
This is for instance the case of the module ''numpy'', which would have been really convenient for analysing data and results.

But see these java numerical libraries: http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/#libraries , of which:

*JaMa (Java Matrix Package)
*Java3D (particularly its [http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/forDevelopers/j3dapi/javax/vecmath/package-summary.html vecmath] package provides general matrix and vector classes ([http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/forDevelopers/j3dapi/javax/vecmath/GMatrix.html GMatrix], [http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/forDevelopers/j3dapi/javax/vecmath/GVector.html GVector]).

... are already included in Fiji.

== Jython tutorials for ImageJ ==

=== Defining variables: obtaining the current image ===

<source lang="python">
imp = IJ.getImage()
</source>

Which is the same as:
<source lang="python">
imp = WindowManager.getCurrentImage()
</source>

Since calling the above is long and tedious, one can declare a variable that points to the above static methods:

<source lang="python">
c = WindowManager.getCurrentImage
</source>

Above note the lack of parentheses.

To execute the function, just use parentheses on it:

<source lang="python">
 imp = c()
</source>

The above gets the value of <i>c</i>, which is the method named getCurrentImage in class WindowManager, and executes it, storing its returned object in <i>imp</i>.


=== Manipulating pixels ===

==== Creating a grayscale ramp image ====
First create an image and obtain its pixels:

<source lang="python">
imp = ImagePlus("my new image", FloatProcessor(512, 512))
pix = imp.getProcessor().getPixels()
</source>

The length of an array:

<source lang="python">
n_pixels = len(pix)
</source>

Then loop to modify them:
 
<source lang="python">
# catch width
w = imp.getWidth()
 
# create a ramp gradient from left to right
for i in range(len(pix)):
   pix[i] = i % w
 
# adjust min and max, since we know them
imp.getProcessor().setMinAndMax(0, w-1)
</source>

... and show the new image:

<source lang="python">
imp.show()
</source>


==== Creating a random 8-bit image ====

First import necessary packages: Random, from standard java util library, and [http://www.jython.org/archive/21/docs/jarray.html jarray], the Jython module for native java arrays:

<source lang="python">
from java.awt import Random
from jarray import zeros
</source>

Then create the array and fill it with random bytes:

<source lang="python">
width = 512
height = 512
 
pix = zeros(width * height, 'b')
Random().nextBytes(pix)
</source>

('z' = boolean, 'c' = char, 'b' = byte, 'h' = short, 'i' = int, 'l' = long, 'f' = float and 'd' = double, as explained in the [http://www.jython.org/archive/21/docs/jarray.html jarray documentation].)

Now make a new IndexColorModel (that's what ImageJ's ij.process.LUT class is) for 8-bit images:

<source lang="python">
channel = zeros(256, 'b')
for i in range(256):
    channel[i] = (i -128) 
cm = LUT(channel, channel, channel)
</source>

... and compose a ByteProcessor from the pixels, and assign it to an ImagePlus:

<source lang="python">
imp = ImagePlus("Random", ByteProcessor(width, height, pix, cm)
imp.show()
</source>

==== Creating a random image, the easy way ====

All the above can be summarized like the following:

<source lang="python">
from java.util import Random
imp = IJ.createImage("A Random Image", "8-bit", 512, 512, 1)
Random().nextBytes(imp.getProcessor().getPixels())
imp.show()
</source>

=== Running a watershed plugin on an image ===

<source lang="python">
# 1 - Obtain an image
blobs = IJ.openImage("http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/images/blobs.gif")
# Make a copy with the same properties as blobs image:
imp = blobs.createImagePlus()
ip = blobs.getProcessor().duplicate()
imp.setProcessor("blobs copy", ip)

# 2 - Apply a threshold: only zeros and ones
# Set the desired threshold range: keep from 0 to 74
ip.setThreshold(147, 147, ImageProcessor.NO_LUT_UPDATE)
# Call the Thresholder to convert the image to a mask
IJ.run(imp, "Convert to Mask", "")

# 3 - Apply watershed
# Create and run new EDM object, which is an Euclidean Distance Map (EDM)
# and run the watershed on the ImageProcessor:
EDM().toWatershed(ip)

# 4 - Show the watersheded image:
imp.show()
</source>

The EDM plugin that contains the watershed could have been indirectly applied to the currently active image, which is <i>not</i> recommended:

<source lang="python">
imp = IJ.getImage()  # the current image
imp.getProcessor().setThreshold(174, 174, ImageProcessor.NO_LUT_UPDATE)
IJ.run(imp, "Convert to Mask", "")
IJ.run(imp, "Watershed", "")
</source>

If you had called <i>show()</i> on the image at any early stage, just update the screen with:

<source lang="python">
imp.updateAndDraw()
</source>


==== ... and counting particles, and measuring their areas ====

Continuing from the <i>imp</i> above, that contains the now watersheded "blobs" sample image:

<source lang="python">
# Create a table to store the results
table = ResultsTable()
# Create a hidden ROI manager, to store a ROI for each blob or cell
roim = RoiManager(True)
# Create a ParticleAnalyzer, with arguments:
# 1. options (could be SHOW_ROI_MASKS, SHOW_OUTLINES, SHOW_MASKS, SHOW_NONE, ADD_TO_MANAGER, and others; combined with bitwise-or)
# 2. measurement options (see [http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/developer/api/ij/measure/Measurements.html Measurements])
# 3. a ResultsTable to store the measurements
# 4. The minimum size of a particle to consider for measurement
# 5. The maximum size (idem)
# 6. The minimum circularity of a particle
# 7. The maximum circularity
pa = ParticleAnalyzer(ParticleAnalyzer.ADD_TO_MANAGER, Measurements.AREA, table, 0, Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY, 0.0, 1.0)
pa.setHideOutputImage(True)

if pa.analyze(imp):
  print "All ok"
else:
  print "There was a problem in analyzing", blobs

# The measured areas are listed in the first column of the results table, as a float array:
areas = table.getColumn(0)

</source>

To print out the area measurement of each:

 >>> for area in areas: print area
 76.0
 185.0
 658.0
 434.0
 ...


Now, we want to measure the intensity of each particle. To do so, we'll retrieve the ROI from the ROIManager, set them one at a time on the original (non-watershed, non-thresholded) image stored in the variable <i>blobs</i>, and measure:

<source lang="python">
# Create a new list to store the mean intensity values of each blob:
means = []

for roi in RoiManager.getInstance().getRoisAsArray():
  blobs.setRoi(roi)
  stats = blobs.getStatistics(Measurements.MEAN)
  means.append(stats.mean)
</source>

Finally read out the measured mean intensity value of each blob, along with its area:

<source lang="python">
for area, mean in zip(areas, means):
  print area, mean
</source>

 6.0 191.47368421052633
 185.0 179.2864864864865
 658.0 205.61702127659575
 434.0 217.32718894009216
 477.0 212.1425576519916
 ...

=== Creating an image from a text file ===

A data file containing rows with 4 columns:

 ...
 399 23 30 10.12
 400 23 30 12.34
 ...

... where the columns are X, Y, Z and value, for every pixel in the image.
We assume we know the width and height of the image.
From this sort of data, we create an image, read out all lines and parse the numbers:

<source lang="python">
width = 512
height = 512
stack = ImageStack(width, height)

file = open("/home/albert/Desktop/data.txt", "r")

try:
  fp = FloatProcessor(width, height)
  pix = fp.getPixels()
  cz = 0
  # Add as the first slice:
  stack.addSlice(str(cz), fp)
  # Iterate over all lines in the text file:
  for line in file.readlines():
    x, y, z, value = line.split(" ")
    x = int(x)
    y = int(y)
    z = int(z)
    value = float(value)
    # Advance one slice if the Z changed:
    if z != cz:
      # Next slice
      fp = FloatProcessor(width, height)
      pix = fp.getPixels()
      stack.addSlice(str(cz), fp)
      cz += 1
    # Assign the value:
    pix[y * width + x] = value
  # Prepare and show a new image:  
  imp = ImagePlus("parsed", stack)
  imp.show()
# Ensure closing the file handle even if an error is thrown:
finally:
  file.close()
</source>


=== Obtain/View histogram and measurements from an image ===

The easiest way is to grab an image and call an ImageJ command to show its histogram:

<source lang="python">
imp = IJ.openImage("http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/images/blobs.gif")
IJ.run(imp, "Histogram", "")
</source>

How ImageJ does it, internally, has to do with the [http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/developer/api/ij/process/ImageStatistics.html ImageStatisics] class:

<source lang="python">
stats = imp.getStatistics()
print stats.histogram
</source>

 array('i',[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 53, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 304,
            0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1209, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3511, 0,
            0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7731, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 10396, 0, 0,
            0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7456, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3829, 0, 0, 0,
            0, 0, 0, 0, 1992, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1394, 0, 0, 0, 0,
            0, 0, 0, 1158, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1022, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
            0, 0, 984, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 902, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
            0, 840, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 830, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
            926, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 835, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 901,
            0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1025, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1180, 0,
            0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1209, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1614, 0, 0,
            0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1609, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2220, 0, 0, 0,
            0, 0, 0, 0, 2037, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2373, 0, 0, 0, 0,
            0, 0, 0, 1568, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1778, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
            0, 0, 774, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1364, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])


The histogram, area and mean are computed by default. Other values like the median need to be specified.

To calculate other parameters, specify them by bitwise-or composition (see flags in [http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/developer/api/ij/measure/Measurements.html Measurements]):

<source lang="python">
stats = imp.getStatistics(Measurements.MEAN | Measurements.MEDIAN | Measurements.AREA)
print "mean:", stats.mean, "median:", stats.median, "area:", stats.area
</source>

 mean: 103.26857775590551 median: 64.0 area: 65024.


If we set a ROI to the image, then we are measuring only for the inside of the ROI. Here we set an oval ROI of radius 25 pixels, centered:
<source lang="python">
radius = 25
roi = OvalRoi(imp.width/2 - radius, imp.height/2 -radius, radius*2, radius*2)
imp.setRoi(roi)
stats = imp.getStatistics(Measurements.MEAN | Measurements.MEDIAN | Measurements.AREA)
print "mean:", stats.mean, "median:", stats.median, "area:", stats.area
</source>

 mean: 104.96356275303644 median: 64.0 area: 1976.0



To display the histogram window ourselves, we may use the [http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/developer/api/ij/gui/HistogramWindow.html HistogramWindow] class:

<source lang="python">
hwin = HistogramWindow(imp)
</source>

... of which we may grab the image (the plot itself) and save it:

<source lang="python">
plotimage = hwin.getImagePlus()
IJ.save(plotimage, "/path/to/our/folder/plot.tif")
</source>

=== Removing bleeding from one channel to another ===

The technique to use is to divide one channel by the other: the channel to denoise divided by the channel that bled through.

The relatively high-level way to do it is to split the channels and call the ImageCalculator with a "Divide" argument:

<source lang="python">
# 1 - Obtain an RGB image stack
imp = WindowManager.getCurrentImage()
if imp.getType() != ImagePlus.COLOR_RGB:
  IJ.showMessage("The active image is not RGB!")
  raise RuntimeException("The active image is not RGB!")

if 1 == imp.getNSlices():
  IJ.showMessage("Not a stack!")
  raise RuntimeException("Not a stack!")

# 2 - Prepare stacks to split slices
stack = imp.getStack()
red_stack = ImageStack(imp.width, imp.height)
green_stack = ImageStack(imp.width, imp.height)

# 3 - Iterate all slices -- notice slices are 1<=i<=size
for i in range(1, imp.getNSlices()+1):
  slice = stack.getProcessor(i)
  red_stack.addSlice(str(i), slice.toFloat(0, None))
  green_stack.addSlice(str(i), slice.toFloat(1, None))

# 4 - Apply "divide" via ImageCalculator to the red_stack, which is a new 32-bit stack
# Don't use the parameters "create" or "float" or "32" in the parameters string
# of the calc.calculate call--then the result of the operation would be
# in a new stack that opens beyond our control. Without them, results are
# applied to the red_stack
calc = ImageCalculator()
calc.calculate("Divide stack", ImagePlus("red", red_stack), ImagePlus("green", green_stack))

# 5 - Compose a new color stack
new_stack = ImageStack(imp.width, imp.height)
for i in range(1, imp.getNSlices()+1):
  cp = stack.getProcessor(i).duplicate()
  cp.setPixels(0, red_stack.getProcessor(i))
  new_stack.addSlice(stack.getSliceLabel(i), cp)

# 6 - Show the new image
ImagePlus("Normalized " + imp.title, new_stack).show()
</source>


Alternatively and as an example of direct pixel manipulation, we'll iterate all slices of the image stack, divide the red channel by the green channel, and compose a new stack:

<source lang="python">
# 1 - Obtain an RGB image stack
imp = WindowManager.getCurrentImage()
if imp.getType() != ImagePlus.COLOR_RGB:
  IJ.showMessage("The active image is not RGB!")
  raise RuntimeException("The active image is not RGB!")

if 1 == imp.getNSlices():
  IJ.showMessage("Not a stack!")
  raise RuntimeException("Not a stack!")

stack = imp.getStack()

# 2 - Create a new stack to store the result
new_stack = ImageStack(imp.width, imp.height)

# 3 - Iterate all slices -- notice slices are 1<=i<=size
for i in range(1, imp.getNSlices()+1):
  # Get the slice i
  slice = stack.getProcessor(i)
  # Get two new FloatProcessor with the green and red channel data in them
  red = slice.toFloat(0, None)
  green = slice.toFloat(1, None)
  pix_red = red.getPixels()
  pix_green = green.getPixels()
  # Create a new FloatProcessor for the normalized result
  new_red = FloatProcessor(imp.width, imp.height)
  pix_new_red = new_red.getPixels()
  # Iterate and set all normalized pixels
  for k in range(len(pix_red)):
    if 0 != pix_green[k]:
      pix_new_red[k] = pix_red[k] / pix_green[k]
  # Create a ColorProcessor that has the normalized red and the same green and blue channels
  cp = slice.duplicate()
  cp.setPixels(0, new_red)   # at channel 0, the red
  # Store the normalized slice in the new stack, copying the same slice label
  new_stack.addSlice(stack.getSliceLabel(i), cp)

# 4 - Show the normalized stack
new_imp = ImagePlus("Normalized " + imp.title, new_stack)
new_imp.show()
</source>

Notice that this second approach is much slower: accessing every pixel from jython has a high cost. If you would like to do very fast pixel-level manipulations, use java or [[Clojure Scripting|Clojure]].

=== Subtract the minimal value to an image ===

Which is to say, translate the histogram so that the lowest value is at zero.

<source lang="python">
# Obtain current image and its pixels
imp = IJ.getImage()
pix = imp.getProcessor().convertToFloat().getPixels()

# find out the minimal pixel value
min = reduce(Math.min, pix)

# create a new pixel array with the minimal value subtracted
pix2 = map(lambda x: x - min, pix)

ImagePlus("min subtracted", FloatProcessor(imp.width, imp.height, pix2, None)).show()
</source>

Notice we used:
* The <i>reduce</i> function to obtain a single value from a list of values (the pixel array) by applying a function to every pair of consecutive values (in this case, the Math.min).
* <i>lambda</i>, which is used to declare an anonymous function that takes one argument.
* The <i>map</i> function, which runs a function given as argument to every element of a list (here, every pixel) and returns a new list with all the results.

=== Extract a specific color channel for a given time frame of a composite image ===

Suppose you have a 4D multicolor image, and want to obtain a stack of slices corresponding to a specific color channel and time frame.

The [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/javadoc/ij/CompositeImage.html CompositeImage] is a stack whose slices are interpreted as belonging to specific color channels, Z slices and time frames. To find out which slice corresponds to what, use the <i>getStackIndex</i> method of the [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/javadoc/ij/ImagePlus.html ImagePlus], which translates between color channels, z slices and time frames to the slice index in the underlying [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/javadoc/ij/ImageStack.html ImageStack].

<source lang="python">
from ij import IJ, ImagePlus, ImageStack

def extractChannel(imp, nChannel, nFrame):
 """ Extract a stack for a specific color channel and time frame """
 stack = imp.getImageStack()
 ch = ImageStack(imp.width, imp.height)
 for i in range(1, imp.getNSlices() + 1):
   index = imp.getStackIndex(nChannel, i, nFrame)
   ch.addSlice(str(i), stack.getProcessor(index))
 return ImagePlus("Channel " + str(nChannel), ch)

imp = IJ.getImage()
extractChannel(imp, 1, 1).show()
</source>

Notice that color channels, stack slices and time frames are all 1-based. For example, if you have 3 color channels, then these have indices 1, 2, and 3 (not 0, 1 and 2).


=== Visualize any number of TIFF stacks in a single composite multi-color image stack ===

Suppose you have 1000 stacks of <i>Drosophila</i> fly brains, each with different neurons labeled in a single color channel. Suppose that you have registered all these confocal stacks. Were you to overlay them, you would see whether the labeled neurons overlap in 3D space or not.

Here is a script to do that. First, it asks for a directory containing any number of TIF image stacks. It assumes all stacks have the same dimensions, and that they are all single channel (i.e. just red, or just green, etc.). Then, it displays a small window with a listing of many colors: red, green, blue, orange, gray, etc. Any of the hundreds of stacks in the directory can be assigned to each color channel.

The stacks are accessed in a virtual way, so even 1000 (one thousand) stacks will be managed just fine in small laptop.

One could easily add more color channels. But there are already lots.

The script uses [[Imglib]] scripting to normalize images and generate the color composite. See this [http://www.ini.uzh.ch/~acardona/fiji-tutorial/#s10 imglib scripting tutorial] for in-depth explanations.

== Tips and Tricks ==

=== Getting a list of all members in one package ===

You can use the Python function ''dir(<package>)'' to see the contents of a package:

<source lang="python">
import ij
print dir(ij)
</source>

'''Note:''' As of April 26nd, 2010, you need to start Fiji with

 fiji -Dpython.cachedir.skip=false --

for ''dir(<package>)'' to work.

=== Specifying the encoding of the source ===

When your source code contains non-ASCII characters (such as umlauts), Jython will complain with a ''SyntaxError: Non-ASCII character in file '<iostream>', but no encoding declared''.

You can fix this issue by putting the line

 # -*- coding: iso-8859-15 -*-

as first line into your source code (or if it starts with ''#!/usr/bin/python'', as second line), as suggested [http://docs.python.org/tutorial/interpreter.html#source-code-encoding here]. You might need to replace the string ''iso-8859-15'' by something like ''utf-8'' if your source code is encoded in UTF-8.

=== Changing the default encoding ===

By default, Jython encodes the standard output (and other streams) with the ASCII encoding. Often, this is not what you want. You can change the default encoding like this:

<source lang="python">
from org.python.core import codecs
codecs.setDefaultEncoding('utf-8')
</source>

=== Error handling with try / except / finally ===

See complete documentation at: [http://jythonpodcast.hostjava.net/jythonbook/chapter6.html jython book chapter 6].

<source lang="python">
x = 10
y = 0

try:
     z = x / y
except NameError, e1:
     print "A variable is not defined!", e1
except ZeroDivisionError, e2:
     print "Dividing by zero doesn't make any sense! Error:", e2
finally:
     print "This line will always print no matter what error occurs."
</source>

Which prints:

 Dividing by zero doesn't make any sense! Error: integer division or modulo by zero
 This line will always print no matter what errors occurs

To catch any kind of errors, use <i>sys.exc_info</i>:

<source lang="python">
import sys

try:
  z = x / z
except:
  print "Error: ", sys.exc_info()
</source>

Which prints:

 Error:  (<type 'exceptions.NameError'>, NameError("name 'x' is not defined",), <traceback object at 0x2>)


To ensure that you see the stack trace, print it to the ImageJ log window instead of stdout (whathever the latter may be):

<source lang="python">
    IJ.log(str(sys.exc_info()))
</source>

=== Importing other ''.py'' scripts ===

If you want to import other files, you need to ''import'' them. This requires that the files are found in the so-called ''search path'', a list of directories in which Jython looks for the modules (''.py'' files) to import. You can easily extend the search path:

<source lang="python">
from sys import path
from java.lang.System import getProperty

# extend the search path by $FIJI_ROOT/bin/
path.append(getProperty('fiji.dir') + '/bin')

# Now you can import $FIJI_ROOT/bin/compat.py
import compat
</source>

A situation you are likely to encounter is when you have multiple jython scripts in a folder under the fiji plugins folder.

For example, suppose you have the folder ''my scripts'' under the fiji ''plugins'' folder, in which you have the script ''Filters.py'' with the following filter functions in it:

<source lang="python">
# Script plugins/my scripts/Filters.py
from ij import IJ
from ij.plugin import Duplicator

def median(imp, radius):
  """ Apply a median filter to a copy
      of the given ImagePlus, and return it. """
  copy = Duplicator().run(imp)
  IJ.run(copy, "Median...", "radius=" + str(radius))
  return copy

def removeOutliers(imp, radius, threshold, bright):
  """ Apply a remove outliers filter to a copy
      of the given ImagePlus, and return it. """
  copy = Duplicator().run(imp)
  which = "Bright" if bright else "Dark"
  IJ.run(copy, "Remove Outliers...", "radius=" + str(radius) \
      + " threshold=" + str(threshold) + " which=" + which)
  return copy
</source>

And now you have a second script in which you want to use a function from the ''Filters.py'' script:

<source lang="python">
from ij import IJ
import sys
from java.lang.System import getProperty
sys.path.append(getProperty("fiji.dir") + "/plugins/my scripts")
from Filters import median

imp = IJ.getImage()
medianFiltered = median(imp, 5.0)
medianFiltered.show()
</source>

=== Defining a class and creating instances of the new class ===

A simple class to store an X,Y coordinate. (In real code, just use javax.vecmath.* classes such as Point3f, Point3d, etc.)

The constructor is defined with <i>__init__</i>, and takes at least one argument , named <i>self</i> by convention (you may name it something else, like <i>this</i>).

<source lang="python">
from math import sqrt, pow

class Point:
  def __init__(self, x, y):
    self.x = x
    self.y = y
  def distance(self, other):
    return sqrt(pow(self.x - other.x, 2), pow(self.y - other.y, 2))
</source>

... and create two instances, and measure the distance between them. To create the new instances, we use the name of the class with the arguments in brackets:

<source lang="python">
p1 = Point(10, 20)
p2 = Point(40, 55.3)

print "Distance:", p1.distance(p2)
</source>

=== Adding a static method to a class ===

A static method is a method of a class that doesn't need a <i>self</i> first argument. You may call this method by using the name of the class alone--you don't need to invoke it on an instance.

To declare a method as static, decorate it with <i>@staticmethod</i>, as shown below for method <i>two</i>:

<source lang="python">
class Numbers:

  def one(self):
    return 1

  @staticmethod
  def two():
    return 2
</source>

Now, to invoke these methods, notice how <i>two</i> doesn't need to be invoked on an instance (we merely prepend the class name), but <i>one</i> does:

<source lang="python">
print Numbers.two()

that = Numbers()
print that.one()
</source>

Why would you want to use a static method? It is useful to keep the namespace tidy, to avoid name collisions.

=== Creating multi-dimensional native java arrays ===

Suppose you want to create a one-dimensional double array, the equivalent of '''double[]''' in java. This is what you would do:

<source lang="python">
from jarray import array

data = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]

arr = array(data, 'd')
</source>

Other accepted primitive array types are:
 z	boolean
 c	char
 b	byte
 h	short
 i	int
 l	long
 f	float
 d	double

But now suppose you want a two-dimensional double array, the equivalent of '''double[][]''' in java. How to do that? Here's how:

<source lang="python">
from jarray import array

data = [[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]]
twoDimArr = array(data, Class.forName('[D'))
</source>

Essentially, what we did is to give the function '''array''' the argument '''class of a one-dimensional double array''', so that it will create an array of that--hence a two-dimensional double array.

For a three-dimensional array in jython, you'd just add another '''[''' (square bracket) to the class name:

<source lang="python">
from jarray import array

data = [[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]]
threeDimArr = array(data, Class.forName('[[D'))
</source>

See the [http://www.jython.org/archive/21/docs/jarray.html jarray documentation].

To create primitive arrays of any class, pass along the class itself. For example, a native array of '''String''':

<source lang="python">
from jarray import array

texts = ["one", "two", "three"]

strings = array(texts, String)
</source>

Of course arrays can also be created empty. For numbers, all values will be zero. For an arbitrary class such as '''String''', all values will be null (or None, in python parlance).

In the example below, we create an empty two-dimensional array of '''double[N][]''' type, where the smaller, inner arrays are null (just like in java a '''new double[5][]''' would have the second-order also all null):

<source lang="python">
from jarray import zeros

twoDimArr = zeros(5, Class.forName("[D"))

print twoDimArr
# prints: array([D, [None, None, None, None, None])

# fill each slot with a new array of length 3:
for i in range(len(twoDimArr)):
  twoDimArr[i] = zeros(3, 'd')

print twoDimArr
#prints: array([D, [array('d', [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]), array('d', [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]),
# array('d', [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]), array('d', [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]), array('d', [0.0, 0.0, 0.0])])
</source>


=== Inline java code inside jython: the Weaver ===

Jython is great at doing high-level operations on images. But sometimes one wants to edit pixels specifically. Such low-level loops in jython are far from the performance offered by java. But writing a special-purpose java class for a minor piece of code is painful and requires specific java skills regarding code compilation and classpath management.

The weaver removes all the pain. Here is an example, where the <i>float[]</i> pixels array of the current image is iterated to compute the mean intensity:

<source lang="python">
from fiji.scripting import Weaver

# The currently open image
imp = IJ.getImage()

fp = imp.getProcessor().convertToFloat()
pixels = fp.getPixels()  # a float array, float[]
w = Weaver.inline(
    """
    double sum = 0;
    for (int i=0; i<pixels.length; i++) {
        sum += pixels[i];
    }
    return sum / pixels.length;
    """,
    {"pixels" : pixels}, Double)

mean = w.call()

print mean
</source>

The above is trivial and it is meant only as an example (there are better ways to get the mean value, such as via <i>imp.getStatistics()</i>. Notice that the <i>Weaver.inline</i> function takes three arguments: the java code to inline, the map of bindings, and the return type. In the example, we pass only the <i>float[]</i> pixels array, and define <i>Double</i> as the return type. The return type is optional.

Internally, bindings are represented as fields in a java class, set as either primitives (like double, int ...) or the least general public class or superclass of the object to bind.

There is a fourth optional argument for <i>inline</i> (boolean) to show the generated java code in a tab of the Script Editor.

A better example that exploits the capabilities of the Weaver is the following: compile the function once, and then call it over and over with different parameters. The bindings cannot be changed, but if they are arrays or collections, one can change the elements of these collections. For example, to obtain a new ImageStack that is the result of applying XOR to each consecutive pair of slices (which will give you the boundaries of objects):

<source lang="python">
from fiji.scripting import Weaver

# The currently open image, an 8-bit stack
imp = IJ.openImage("http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/images/bat-cochlea-volume.zip")

slices = [None, None]

w = Weaver.inline(
    """
    byte[] pix1 = (byte[]) slices.get(0);
    byte[] pix2 = (byte[]) slices.get(1);

    byte[] xor = new byte[pix1.length];
    for (int i=0; i<pix1.length; i++) {
        xor[i] = (byte)(pix1[i] ^ pix2[i]);
    }
    return xor;
    """,
    {"slices" : slices})

stack = imp.getStack()
stackXOR = ImageStack(stack.width, stack.height)

for i in range(2, imp.getNSlices()+1):
  # Put the pixel arrays into the pre-made list
  slices[0] = stack.getPixels(i-1)
  slices[1] = stack.getPixels(i)
  # Invoke native code
  stackXOR.addSlice( str(i-1), w.call() )

ImagePlus("XORed stack", stackXOR).show()
</source>

Of course the Weaver is a java library, and may be used from any scripting language such as [[Javascript Scripting|Javascript]], [[JRuby Scripting|JRuby]], and [[:Category:Scripting|others]].

All the above is inspired by the [http://www.scipy.org/Cookbook/Weave Scientific Python Weaver, or scipy Weaver], which inlines C code inside a python file.

== Jython for plugins ==

=== Using a jython script as a plugin ===

The simplest way is to place the jython script file into fiji/plugins/ folder or a subfolder, and it will appear in the menus after running "'''Plugins>Scripting>Refresh Jython Scripts'''" or "'''Help>Refresh Menus'''", or on restarting Fiji.

If you want to have the Jython script show up in a place outside the Plugins menu, just put the file into an appropriate subdirectory of fiji/plugins/Scripts/; for example, if you put a Jython script called Animation_.py into fiji/plugins/Scripts/File/New/, it will be available as File>New>Animation .

=== Distributing jython scripts in a .jar file ===

PLEASE NOTE: there is no need to do the following -- unless you want to bundle a couple of scripts in one package. See entry above.

The easiest way to distribute a (single) Jython script is to start the [[Script Editor]], open the Jython script and make the bundle with ''File>Export as .jar''.

Alternatively -- or if you want to bundle multiple scripts -- you can do it the manual way:

The whole idea is to be able to distribute an entire collection of scripts in a single .jar file, for best convenience.

In this example, we create two jython scripts that we want to distribute in a .jar file as plugins:

The <i>printer.py</i> script:

<source lang="python">
IJ.log("Print this to the log window")
</source>

... and the <i>create_new_image.py</i> script:

<source lang="python">
ip = ByteProcessor(400, 400)
imp = ImagePlus("New", ip)
ip.setRoi(OvalRoi(100, 100, 200, 200))
ip.setValue(255)
ip.fill(ip.getMask())
imp.show()
</source>

Place both scripts under a folder named <i>scripts/</i> .

You will need a tiny .java file specifying a launcher PlugIn, such as:

<source lang="java">
package my;
import ij.plugin.PlugIn;
import Jython.Refresh_Jython_Scripts;

public class Jython_Launcher implements PlugIn {
    public void run(String arg) {
        new Refresh_Jython_Scripts().runScript(getClass().getResourceAsStream(arg));
    }
}
</source>

Notice we place the above file under directory <i>my/</i>, packaged.

To compile it:

 $ javac -classpath .:ij.jar:../jars/fiji-scripting.jar:../plugins/Jython_Interpreter.jar my/Jython_Launcher.java 

(check that the path to the three jars that you need is correct!)


Then we define the plugins.config file:

 Plugins>My Scripts, "Print to log window", my.Jython_Launcher("/scripts/printer.py")
 Plugins>My Scripts, "Create image with a white circle", my.Jython_Launcher("/scripts/create_new_image.py")

Finally, we put all files in a .jar file:

 $ jar cf my_jython_scripts.jar plugins.config my/Jython_Launcher.class scripts/*py

Then, drop the jar file into fiji/plugins/ folder and run "Help - Update Menus", or restart fiji. Your scripts will appear under Plugins - My Scripts.

For clarity, this is a summary of the files in the folder:
 my/Jython_Launcher.java
 my/Jython_Launcher.class
 scripts/printer.py
 scripts/create_new_image.py
 plugins.config


Notice, though, that <b>you don't need to do the .jar packaging at all</b>. Just place the python scripts directly under fiji/plugins/My Scripts/ and they will appear in the menus as regular plugins.
