In addition to the manual view alignment functionality in '''Stitching mode''' (see [[BigStitcher_manual_translation|here]] for details), which focuses on the translational alignment of tiled images, we offer offer complementary functions for '''manually transforming''' images and '''managing transformations''' in '''MultiView mode'''.

These functions can be found under <code>Calibration/Transformations</code> in the main menu of the MultiView mode.

The BigDataViewer offers its own functionality for transforming views or view groups. Clicking {{Key|t}} in the BigDataViewer window will start the transformation. Now, you can transform the views via clicking and dragging the mouse. Click {{Key|t}} again to apply the transformation or {{Key|Esc}} to cancel the transformation.

The transformation will affect the '''current view (group)'''. Views or groups can be selected in the '''visibility and grouping''' window (press {{Key|F6}} in BigDataViewer or open it via the menu). For details on view transformation in BigDataViewer, please refer to the corresponding [[BigDataViewer#Usage|documentation]].

Normally, the manual transformations from BDV are not propagated to BigStitcher/Multiview Reconstruction and thus will be lost once you close the BigDataViewer.

The '''Bake BDV manual transform''' will take the manual transformations for the selected views from BigDataViewer and append them to the dataset's registrations.
