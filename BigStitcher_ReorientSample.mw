In addition to the manual view alignment functionality in '''Stitching mode''' (see [[BigStitcher_manual_translation|here]] for details), which focuses on the translational alignment of tiled images, we offer offer complementary functions for '''manually transforming''' images and '''managing transformations''' in '''MultiView mode'''.

These functions can be found under <code>Calibration/Transformations</code> in the main menu of the MultiView mode.

== Bake BDV manual transform ==

The BigDataViewer offers its own functionality for transforming views or view groups. Clicking {{Key|t}} in the BigDataViewer window will start the transformation. Now, you can transform the views via clicking and dragging the mouse. Click {{Key|t}} again to apply the transformation or {{Key|Esc}} to cancel the transformation.

The transformation will affect the '''current view (group)'''. Views or groups can be selected in the '''visibility and grouping''' window (press {{Key|F6}} in BigDataViewer or open it via the menu). For details on view transformation in BigDataViewer, please refer to the corresponding [[BigDataViewer#Usage|documentation]].

Normally, the manual transformations from BDV are not propagated to BigStitcher/Multiview Reconstruction and thus will be lost once you close the BigDataViewer.

The '''Bake BDV manual transform''' will take the manual transformations for the selected views from BigDataViewer and append them to the dataset's registrations.

== Remove Transformation ==

Under this menu item, you have the option to remove '''Latest/Newest Transformation''' or the '''First/Oldest Transformation''' (typically the '''calibration''') for all selected views.

As every registration step adds a new transformation, you can use '''Remove Latest/Newest Transformation''' to '''un-do''' a bad registration (note that there is no re-do, it will be gone forever, unless you saved before).

== Interactively Reorient Sample ==

Clicking this will open up a new window that listens for the '''global transformation''' of the BigDataViewer. You can then '''Apply the Transformation''' from BDV to all selected views. This is a convenient way of interactively re-orienting the sample, e.g. to be aligned to the coordinate system axes.

You can choose to '''Ignore scaling factor from BigDataViewer''' - this way, we will extract the sample rotation, but not any effects of zooming. Note that the scaling depends on the BDV window size, among other things, and you can achieve a zoom-out when fusing by using downsampling - we suggest to ignore the scaling unless you know what you are doing.

Note that the identity transformation corresponds to an xy-View of the data in BDV. To avoid confusion, we advise to reset the view (by clicking {{Key|Shift|Z}} in the BDV window) before you start the interactive reorientation.
