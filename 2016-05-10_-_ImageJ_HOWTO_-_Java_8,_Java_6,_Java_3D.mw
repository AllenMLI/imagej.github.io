[[ImageJ2]] (and hence also [[Fiji]]) is currently in the midst of a [[2015-12-22 - The road to Java 8|transition to Java 8]].

However, at the moment, it is still possible to run a (slightly outdated now) version of [[Fiji]] with Java 6.

[[Fiji/Downloads|Download the newest Fiji]] for your platform. It comes bundled with Java 8, with the Java-8 update site enabled.
| Run [[Updater|{{bc|Help|Update...}}]] to update to the latest version of ImageJ core and Fiji components.
| This version of Fiji comes bundled with Java 3D 1.6. The [[3D Viewer]] works out of the box, though there are [https://github.com/search?q=label%3Ajava-3d+is%3Aopen+user%3Afiji+user%3Aimagej&type=Issues still some bugs].

* If you have Java 7 and/or Java 8 installed, uninstall themâ€”or else ImageJ will not use your Java 6 installation.
* Afterwards, [[Troubleshooting#Checking_the_Java_version|verify that Fiji is using Java 6]].

[[Downloads|Download the newest ImageJ]] for your platform. It comes bundled ''without'' Java, and ''without'' the Java-8 update site enabled.
* If you have not already done so: install Java 8 from [http://java.com/ java.com].
* Do '''not''' enable the Java-8 update site, because (at the moment) it contains a mixture of core ImageJ and Fiji components.
| rowspan=2 | Run [[Updater|{{bc|Help|Update...}}]] to update to the latest '''Java-6-compatible''' version. Your ImageJ will become outdated over time, stuck on the final Java-6-compatible plugin versions.
| rowspan=2 | The [[3D Viewer]] is not bundled with "plain" ImageJ2 (yet). It is (for now) part of the Fiji update site.

| It is possible to set up a "plain" ImageJ2 with Java 6, but '''not recommended''':
* Set up [[Fiji]] + Java 6 as described above.
* Disable the Fiji update site.
* Restart ImageJ.
* Delete all Fiji-specific files using the updater's Advanced mode, View "Local only files" and deleting them all.

== About the Java-8 update site ==

Right now, the <code>Java-8</code> update site includes the latest Java-8 versions of all core ImageJ '''and''' Fiji components. So unfortunately, at the moment, there is no way to get a "latest and greatest plain ImageJ2" built on Java 8, but without Fiji components.

But later this year, we will migrate the latest Java-8 components back to the core <code>ImageJ</code> and <code>Fiji</code> update sites, respectively, so that users can choose between "plain" ImageJ2 (lighter weight without "plugin bloat") and Fiji (with "more parts on the table"). We only want to proceed with this migration once there is a mechanism in place to notify users that Java 8 is now required, without breaking existing installations.

== About Java 3D ==

* Java 3D 1.6 requires Java 7 or newer. Hence, we ship it '''on the Java-8 update site only'''.
* Java 3D 1.5 works with Java 6, but:
** It has a restrictive license.
** It does not work Java 7 or 8 on OS X.
** It does not work with Java 8 (or 7?) on some Windows systems.

Please be aware that Java 3D is essentially a dead technology. The future of 3D visualization in ImageJ is the [[ClearVolume]] plugin. But we still need to do some work to rebuild the [[3D Viewer]] on top of ClearVolume.
