[[ImageJ2]] (and hence also [[Fiji]]) is currently in the midst of a [[2015-12-22 - The road to Java 8|transition to Java 8]].

However, at the moment, it is still possible to run a (slightly outdated now) version of [[Fiji]] with Java 6.

Here is breakdown of the current recommendations and possibilities:

[[Fiji/Downloads|Download the newest Fiji]] for your platform. It comes bundled with Java 8, with the Java-8 update site enabled.
| Run [[Updater|{{bc|Help|Update...}}]] to update to the latest version of ImageJ core and Fiji components.
| This version of Fiji comes bundled with Java 3D 1.6. The [[3D Viewer]] works out of the box, though there are [https://github.com/search?q=label%3Ajava-3d+is%3Aopen+user%3Afiji+user%3Aimagej&type=Issues still some bugs].

This version comes bundled with Java 6, with the Java-8 update site ''disabled''.

| Download the 2015-Dec-22 [[Fiji/Downloads#Life-Line_Fiji_versions|Life-Line version of Fiji]] for OS X.
This version is distributed ''without'' Java, so you must [[Frequently Asked Questions#How_do_I_set_up_Java_6_on_OS_X.3F|install Apple Java 6]] on your system.
* If you have Java 7 and/or Java 8 installed, uninstall themâ€”or else ImageJ will not use your Java 6 installation.
* Afterwards, [[Troubleshooting#Checking_the_Java_version|verify that Fiji is using Java 6]].
