<div style="float: left; padding-right: 10px">__TOC__</div>ImageJ is an open source Java image processing program inspired by [[NIH Image]]. It runs on any computer with a Java 1.6 or later virtual machine. [[Downloads|Downloadable distributions]] are available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. ImageJ has a strong, established user base, with thousands of [[plugins]] and [[macros]] for performing a wide variety of tasks.

== Flavors ==

There are a few different flavors of ImageJ with very similar names, and some confusion is inevitable. Below is a table which should help to clarify the purpose of each. For the historical context of these projects, see [[#History|History]] below.

ImageJDev
|[[Contributors|ImageJ developers]]
|A new version of ImageJ targeting scientific multidimensional image data. It is a complete rewrite of ImageJ, but includes [[ImageJ1]] with a compatibility layer, so that old-style plugins and macros can run the same as always. ImageJ2 provides several significant new features, such as an automatic [[updater]], and improved [[scripting]] capabilities.

|[[Contributors|ImageJ developers]]

ImageJA is a project that provides a clean [[Git]] history of ImageJ1, with a proper 'pom.xml' file so that it can be used with Maven without hassles.

It is what ImageJ2's legacy support uses at its core.

'''F'''iji '''i'''s '''J'''ust '''I'''mageJ, with extras. It is a distribution of ImageJ with many plugins useful for image analysis in the life sciences. It is actively maintained, with updates released often.

As of June 2014, Fiji is based on ImageJ2, adding Fiji-specific customization and plugins.

We recommend Fiji as the preferred version of ImageJ.

|[[MBF ImageJ]]

The MBF "ImageJ for Microscopy" bundle (formerly [http://www.uhnres.utoronto.ca/facilities/wcif/imagej/ WCIF ImageJ]) is a collection of plugins and macros, collated and organized by the [http://www.macbiophotonics.ca/ MacBiophotonics] facility.

It went hand in hand with a comprehensive manual describing how to use the bundle with light microscopy image data. It was a great resource by microscopists, for microscopists. Unfortunately, the manual went offline in late 2012. Nonetheless, it is often possible to add specific plugins from MBF ImageJ to a Fiji installation, combining the best of both programs.

|[[ImageJX]]
|Grant Harris
|
ImageJX was created as a means to discuss and explore improvements to ImageJ. There was an [http://groups.google.com/group/imagejx ImageJX mailing list] as well as an ImageJX software prototype.

The ImageJX software prototype was a proof of conceptâ€”an attempt to reorganize ImageJ's internals to make it more flexible. The prototype demonstrated this flexibility by recasting the program in Swing. The ImageJX project formed the basis of an application to NIH for funding, which is what launched the ImageJ2 project (see above).
