== Introduction ==

This tutorial show how to manually edit, correct and create spots and tracks in [[TrackMate]]. You might want to use manual editing to correct mistakes of automated segmenting or tracking, to do a full manual annotation of a dataset, or to create a "ground-truth" data.

Manual annotation is seldom the most adequate alternative: depending on the size of the target data, it can take an important amount of time and energy, is not objective, and is not reproducible. But sometimes you have to bite the bullet, whether because a segmenter does not exist for your kind of images, or because it is quicker to manually correct error than to come with the ultimate, flawless algorithm. 

Also, tracking is difficult in bio-imaging: images have by construction often a very low SNR, and there is a very wide range of variability amongst experiment types. TrackMate includes generic tracking and segmentation algorithms, and therefore does not exploit the specificity of each problem. It is likely that there are going to be some defects on the difficult use cases you will use it on, and these defects should not stop your science. So there should be a way to manually correct and edit the tracking results. We tried to make it as convenient, easy and quick as possible in TrackMate, should your science requires it.

It is a good idea to be already familiar with the automated segmentation in TrackMate, following the [[Getting started with TrackMate]] tutorial. Here, we will use an incorrect automated segmentation result, and correct it manually. It is perfectly possible to skip the automated part and to do the whole process manually. 

== The test image: Development of a ''C.elegans'' embryo ==

Download the target image here: [http://fiji.sc/tinevez/TrackMate/Celegans-5pc_17timepoints.zip Celegans-5pc_17timepoints.zip (34 MB)]. It is a rather large file, so it is zipped. Unzip it somewhere; you should end up having a single tiff file, ''Celegans-5pc_17timepoints.tif'' of about 100 MB.

Open it in Fiji. You will get a stack, made of 41 Z-slices over 17 time-points, each image being 240 x 295. As you can see in ''Image > Properties'' (Ctrl+Shift+P), it has a spatial and temporal calibration. 

The context if the following: We used a ''C.elegans'' strain named [http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/strain?name=AZ212;class=Strain AZ212] that has its histone H2B coupled to the eGFP. The nuclei can therefore be seen in the 488 nm excitation fluorescence channel. The movie started just after the first cell division, so you can see on the first frame two blob-like spots in the center of the egg. On the top-right part of the egg, there is also two smaller spots that are the polar bodies. One will remain at a fixed place, the other one will be pushed around as the cells divide. The movie has 17 time-points that span the first 34 minutes of the ''C.elegans'' embryo development. 

[http://www.pasteur.fr/ip/easysite/pasteur/fr/recherche/plates-formes-technologiques/imagopole We] were trying to assess the impact of phototoxicity on development in this movie. We used a rather strong laser power, which explains the relatively good quality of the image, and the fact that this egg's development is slowed down compared to a classical development at 21°C. On this movie, I manually erased another egg that was lying on the top left-corner of the image, which makes it suitable only for educational purposes. 

We want to reconstruct the cell lineage from this movie. Ideally, we will end up in having four tracks: two for the the two cells present on the first frame, and two for the polar bodies. The cell tracks will be branching, following cell division.

This tutorial uses the following strategy: we will use an inadequate set of segmentation parameters to simulate defects in segmentation. Then we will use a tracking algorithm that does not take into account the possibility for a cell to divide, and will not use the spot feature to make linking robust, thus generating linking defects. Finally, we will learn how to correct these defects manually.


== Doing a fast but very bad segmentation ==

[[Image:TrackMate DownsampledLogSegmenter.png|right|border]]

Launch TrackMate (''Plugins > Tracking > Track Mate'') and select the ''C.elegans'' stack as a target. Check on the first panel that all the spatial calibration is OK. The pixel size is about 200 nm in XY, 1 μm in Z, and each frame is separated by 2 minutes.

Select the '''Downsampled LoG segmenter'''. This choice actually makes sense: the nuclei are about 8 μm in diameter, and with a sampling of 200 nm, that makes 40 pixels wide nuclei. It is already advantageous to use the down-sampled version of the LoG segmenter above 20 pixels: segmenting 3D data over time takes already quite some time. Having to track large objects allow to down-sample them, making the data to iterate over smaller, which speed up the process. 

This comes at a cost: the localization precision. To simulate segmentation defects, we will make it very bad. In the segmenter configuration panel, choose a down-sampling factor of 10 (a factor of 4 would have been wiser), and a target nuclei radius of 8 μm, as depicted to the right. 

The segmentation should take you no more than a minute, even on a standard machine, a considerable improvement over a standard segmenter. But at what cost!

On the Initial thresholding panel, we see that it is easy to separate spurious spots using the '''Quality''' feature only. There is a big and sharp peak at the left of the histogram, while fewer spots spread over 40. Let's discard the spurious spots now and put a threshold on quality at about 40, to keep 56 spots. 

Now move to the next panel. On the ''Displayer choice'' panel you must pick the '''HyperStack Displayer'''. It is the only one that allows for manual editing.

On the ''Spot filters'' panel, the results of the segmentation will appear. It is likely that our results are the same if you used the same numerical values as above. So you should see that a nucleus was missed on the first frame, that when a cell just divided in two, there is only one detected spot, and that almost all polar bodies are incorrectly segmented. These are expected defects given our choice of segmentation algorithm and the parameters we have used. 

We could fix them right now, before tracking. As soon as the HyperStack displayer catches your data, it can edit it at anytime in the process. But let us exploit these defects for our training purpose, by having them generating additional linking defects.

== Generating irrelevant tracks ==

[[Image:Celegans-5pc 17timepoints-Incorrect.png|right|border]]

Normally, TrackMate can robustly handles track splitting events, representing ''e.g.'' cell division. Though this happens in this movie, we choose to dismiss this possibility in the automated tracking part.

In the ''Tracker choice'' panel, select the '''Simple Fast LAP tracker'''. Leave the default values for the parameters, and press '''Next'''. You should end up in having something similar to the image to the right.

A quick assertion shows that for nuclei, the individual track branches are not so bad. Each of the retained spot could use some fine tuning, but the tracks are not completely pathological, disregarding the fact that splitting events are missed. The polar bodies tracking results are hopeless. 

This is what we will now manually correct.

== Launching TrackScheme ==

Move to the ''Display options'' panel, skipping the track filtering part. 

Launching [[TrackScheme]] is the only way to manually edit the tracks in TrackMate (the spots can be edited as soon as the HyperStack displayer is launched). You could launch it now by pressing the '''TrackScheme''' button, but there is a convenience trick you can do first. 

Move the to next panel, the ''Action chooser'' panel. In the combo box, select the '''Grab spot image''' action, and press the execute button. Once it is done, go back to the ''Display option'' panel, and press the '''TrackScheme''' button to launch TrachScheme. 

TrackScheme displays a kind of "track map", where a track is laid on pane, arranged vertically over time, as a Parisian subway train map. Each spot is displayed as a cell in the map. Since we used the '''Grab spot image''' action before, each cell displays a thumbnail of the spot.
