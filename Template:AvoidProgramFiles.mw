{{Warning
| message = <div style="font-size: large; color: red; padding-bottom: 10px">Caution: "<code>Program Files</code>" not recommended!</div>If you are installing ImageJ on Windows, we strongly recommend that you store your ImageJ.app directory somewhere in your user space (e.g., "<code>C:\Users\[your name]\ImageJ.app</code>") rather than in "<code>C:\Program Files</code>" or other system-wide directory. If you move ImageJ.app to such a directory, modern versions of Windows will deny ImageJ write permission to its own directory structure, preventing it from being able to update.
