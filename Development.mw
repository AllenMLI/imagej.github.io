== Open source ==

The [[ImageJ]] project, and related projects in the [[SciJava]] software ecosystem, are [[open source]] software projects.  Everybody is welcome to [[contribute]] with [[plugins]], patches, [[Bugs|bug reports]], [[tutorials]], [[documentation]], and artwork.

The [[SciJava]] ecosystem is strongly committed to [[open source]] software development. But this software is not an [[open source]] software ''product''â€”it is an [[open source]] software ''project'' following an [[open source]] development ''process''. There are public [[Source Code|source code repositories]], public [[mailing lists]], public [[IRC|chat rooms]], public [[project management]] resources, and of course, this [[Help:Contents|community editable website]]. See the [[Philosophy]] page for more information.

== Project structure ==

The structure of [[ImageJ]], and related projects in the [[SciJava]] software ecosystem, can be conceptualized in several different ways, with each perspective having its own dedicated wiki page:
{| class="wikitable"
| '''Page'''
| '''Perspective'''
| '''Description'''
|-
| [[Architecture]]
| Technical
| [[ImageJ]] and related [[SciJava]] projects are carefully structured to foster [[extensibility]]. The [[source code]] is on [[GitHub]] across several organizations, structured as [[Maven]] projects.
|-
| [[Licensing]]
| Legal
| [[ImageJ]] and related [[SciJava]] projects are licensed as [[open source]] software (OSS) projects. Most projects use a [[BSD]] style license, though some are [[GPL]].
|-
| [[Governance]]
| Social
| Like any OSS project, [[ImageJ]] and [[SciJava]] need leaders: the ones who participate in ''governance'' of the project, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_maintenance maintaining] the software and making key decisions.
|}

== Source code ==

The source code of [[ImageJ]] and [[SciJava]] is organized into [[Architecture#Modularity|well-separated]] projects. This separation offers many advantages for efficient software development and it is well worth investing a little bit of time to understand. See the [[Source code]] page for further details.

== Project management ==

The [[ImageJ]] and related [[SciJava]] projects take advantage of several project management tools, including [[Git]], [[Maven]], [[GitHub]] and [[Jenkins]]. See the [[Project management]] page for details.
