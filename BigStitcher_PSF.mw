== Overview ==

For deconvolution, it is necessary to have a '''Point spread function (PSF)''' for each image you want to deconvolve. An ideal PSF should represent how a point emitter smaller than the diffraction limit of your optical setup is imaged by your microscope.

PSFs can be be calculated theoretically, but this requires exact modeling of your microscope, so it is more common to use images of sub-diffraction fluorescent beads to estimate the PSF. Since it is common to use fluorescent beads for multi-view registration, you might already have a source of PSFs in you data.

Functions for assigning PSFs to images and managing PSFs can be found in '''MultiView mode''' in the right-click menu under {{bc|Processing|Point Spread Functions}}.
