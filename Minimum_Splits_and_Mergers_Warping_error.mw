When segmenting images with multiple objects, one might decide that some errors are not relevant compared to others. One of the advantages of the [[Topology preserving warping error | warping error]] is that it allows us to focus on only some desired types of topological errors<ref name="Viren2010">{{cite journal

Here we propose a [[Category:Segmentation|segmentation]] metric that takes only into account the '''number of splits and mergers''' produced while comparing two different labelings.

Given a set of original (binary) labels and its corresponding proposed (grayscale, i.e., probability map) labels, we can display the number of splits and mergers as a function of the threshold used to binarize the proposed labels (see Figure 1). 

In the classic [[Topology preserving warping error | warping error]], all pixels belonging to a topological error add to the final metric value. To make the result more intuitive, one can filter those pixels and select only the ones in which we are interested on, in our case, splits and mergers. This way, the metric value will correspond to the number of pixels of each split and merger divided by the total number of pixels. In other words, the metric represents the number of pixels that are needed to correct the segmentation.
