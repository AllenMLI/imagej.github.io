When segmenting images with multiple objects, one might decide that some errors are not relevant compared to others. One of the advantages of the [[Topology preserving warping error | warping error]] is that it allows us to focus on only some desired types of topological errors<ref name="Viren2010">{{cite journal

}}</ref>. Here we propose a [[Category:Segmentation|segmentation]] metric that takes only into account the number of splits and mergers produced while comparing two different labelings.

Given a set of original (binary) labels and its corresponding proposed (grayscale / probability map) labels, we can display the number of splits and mergers as a function of the threshold used to binarize the proposed labels. In the classic [[Topology preserving warping error | warping error]], all pixels belonging to a topological error add to the final metric value. This makes the result very intuitive, because it corresponds to the number of pixels of each topological ''mistake'' committed with the proposed labels. In other words, the metric represents the number of pixels that are needed to correct the segmentation.
