This is a Fiji plugin based on the [http://www.siox.org SIOX project] by Prof. Dr. [http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/inst/ag-ki/rojas_home/pmwiki/pmwiki.php Ra√∫l Rojas] '''to segment color images'''.  [[SIOX]] stands for ''Simple Interactive Object Extraction'' and is a solution for '''extracting foreground from still images''' with very little user interaction. [[SIOX]] is fast, noise robust, and can therefore also be used for the segmentation of videos. It avoids many of the drawbacks of graph-based segmentation methods but performs about equally well on different benchmarks. [[SIOX]] is open and free (Apache License) and the authors have intentionally not patented any part of the technology. As a result, it has been integrated into several open-source image manipulation programs over the past years. [[SIOX]] is the underlying algorithm of the foreground extraction tool in the GNU Image Manipulation Program ([http://www.gimp.org/ GIMP]) and is part of the tracer tool in [http://www.inkscape.org/ Inkscape]. [[SIOX]] originates from [http://www.echalk.de/ E-Chalk] where an instructor standing in front of an electronic chalkboard is segmented. Variants of [[SIOX]] are being used for robotic vision and for improving 3D time-of-flight camera segmentation.
