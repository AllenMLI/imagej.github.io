This is a Fiji plugin based on the [http://www.siox.org SIOX project] by Prof. Dr. [http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/inst/ag-ki/rojas_home/pmwiki/pmwiki.php RaÃºl Rojas] '''to segment color images'''.  [[SIOX]] stands for ''Simple Interactive Object Extraction'' and is a solution for '''extracting foreground from still images''' with very little user interaction. [[SIOX]] is fast, noise robust, and can therefore also be used for the segmentation of videos. It avoids many of the drawbacks of graph-based segmentation methods but performs about equally well on different benchmarks. [[SIOX]] is open and free (Apache License) and the authors have intentionally not patented any part of the technology. As a result, it has been integrated into several open-source image manipulation programs over the past years. [[SIOX]] is the underlying algorithm of the foreground extraction tool in the GNU Image Manipulation Program ([http://www.gimp.org/ GIMP]) and is part of the tracer tool in [http://www.inkscape.org/ Inkscape]. [[SIOX]] originates from [http://www.echalk.de/ E-Chalk] where an instructor standing in front of an electronic chalkboard is segmented. Variants of [[SIOX]] are being used for robotic vision and for improving 3D time-of-flight camera segmentation.

==Quick Start==
;'''Premises:'''
:In order to call the plugin, you need to have at least one '''RGB color image''' open. 

Then, after clicking on ''Plugins > Segmentation > SIOX: Simple Interactive Object Extraction'', the image will be embeded into a GUI.

;'''Step 1:''' Initial Segmentation.
:Paint the regions of interest (ROIs) for the foreground and background. Select any of the ROI tools and mark the areas you consider foreground and background. If you are segmenting multiple objects, select "Allow multiple foreground components"

;'''Step 2:''' Detail Refinement Brush.
:Select now ROIs that you want to add or subtract from the current segmentation. Press "Refine" to add/subtract those areas based on the previous segmentation.

;'''Step 3:''' Reset or Create mask.
:Click the "Reset" button to restart the process or click on the "Create mask" button to produce the current binary result. Please, take into account that the binary image will be created with the background color selected on "Process > Binary > Options".

==User Manual==
[[SIOX]] is a plugin designed to segment 2D color images. If your image is not RGB color, you can change it on the menu ''Image > Type > RGB Color''. However, the [[SIOX]] uses the color information from the images, so it's expected to work much better on real RGB images.

When calling the plugin, your color image will be embedded into the [[SIOX]] graphical user interface (GUI). This GUI has 3 different manipulation panels: Initial Segmentation, Detail Refinement Brush and the mask/reset buttons.

===Initial Segmentation===
[[Image:SIOX-Initial-Segmentation.png|thumb|250px|SIOX initial segmentation panel]]
This is the first step of the plugin. Here you will define the ROIs that you consider part of the foreground or background. 

By clicking on the radio buttons ''Foreground'' and  ''Background'' you will switch between both ROIs. If the foreground ROIs are being defined, the background ROIs will be displayed in translucent '''red'''. The same way, while defining the background ROIs, the foreground ROIs will be displayed in translucent '''green'''.

The ROIs can be defined with any of the Fiji selection tools:

'''TIP''': you can select multiple ROIs in Fiji with any of the selection tools by pressing the SHIFT key and clicking on different parts of the image.

If you expect multiple objects to be segmented, you should click on the check-box ''Allow multiple foreground components''. That will tell [[SIOX]] to look for several objects.
