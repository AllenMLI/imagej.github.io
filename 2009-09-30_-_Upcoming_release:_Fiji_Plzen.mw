A new release of Fiji is around the corner.  If you want to test-drive it, please check out the [[Downloads#Release_candidate|Release candidate]].

In our tradition to name releases after a city where we worked on the release, this release will be called ''Fiji [[wikipedia:Plzeň|Plzeň]]''.

The biggest news is certainly the new Fiji Updater, result of our second [[2009-03-18 - Google Summer of Code|Summer of Code]] project.  It is a well-needed improvement of the old updater, which did not even have a notion of what plugin requires which libraries.  One of the most visible changes is that the updater will check upon startup whether there are new plugins/components available (you can choose never to check again, though).

Stay tuned for the full release notes!
