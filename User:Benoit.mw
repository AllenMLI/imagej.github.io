Hi there!

I am doing Image analysis consulting at Scionics GmbH and the Max Planck Institute of Cell Molecular Biology and Genetics (MPI-CBG) in Dresden. Project are focused on Light Microscopy, Electron Microscopu and High Content Screening data.

Image analysis tools:
* [[Manual drift correction plugin]] : A simple script for doing manual sequence registration with minimal user input. sparsely annotate a reference point and its trajectory will be interpolated in between.
* [[Minimum Cost Z surface Projection]] provide tools and plugin to detect 2D surface in 3D data. one can retrieve the altitute map of the surface and an image with the signal of the surface.
* [[Interactive Watershed]]: Process watershed once then adjust its parameter interactively while the result is overlaid to the image . That is the function of this plugin. It very praticle for data exploration and Yes it works in 3D
* [[CIP]] a toolbox to simplify scripting in ImageJ. Well suited to do you first step in image analysis scripting, teaching and workflow prototyping.

published user project:
* [[MS-ECS-2D]] update site
* [[CElegansBeadsAnalysis plugin]] (my first IJ script/plugin ;-)
