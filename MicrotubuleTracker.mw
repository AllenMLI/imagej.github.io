== Description ==
The Microtubule Tracker is a tool to track and analyze the Microtubules that grow and shrink as filaments. It was developed for experiments done in-vitro with a TIRF microscope with seeded Microtubules which grow and shrink over time. 

The visualized data comprises of a 2D seed image from which the Microtubules grow followed by a time-lapse sequence of dynamically growing seed ends. The file format required for the tracker is TIF.

The Microtubule tracker comes as a tri-modular tool. The first module is live tracking of the growing seed ends, the second module requires the track files generated by the first module to obtain the growth, shrinkage rates and catastrophe and rescue frequencies. A subset of the second module compute statistics such as the length and lifetime distribution when analyzing track files in batch mode.
