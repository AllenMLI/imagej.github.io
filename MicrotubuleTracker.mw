== Description ==
The Microtubule Tracker is a tool to track and analyze the Microtubules that grow and shrink as filaments. It was developed for experiments done in-vitro with a TIRF microscope with seeded Microtubules which grow and shrink over time. 

The visualized data comprises of a 2D seed image from which the Microtubules grow followed by a time-lapse sequence of dynamically growing seed ends. The file format required for the tracker is TIF.

The Microtubule tracker comes as a tri-modular tool. The first module is live tracking of the growing seed ends, the second module requires the track files generated by the first module to obtain the growth, shrinkage rates and catastrophe and rescue frequencies. A subset of the second module compute statistics such as the length and lifetime distribution when analyzing track files in batch mode.

== File Chooser ==
The opening screen of the program is the file chooser where the user chooses the mode in which to run the program in and upload the image files to perform the tracking with. There are three modes in which the program can be run 1) Simple Mode, 2) Advanced Mode, 3) Batch Mode. The Simple mode gives user with some default settings with few choices to make to obtain the tracks. The Advanced mode gives user the full freedom with respect to their choices to obtain the tracks. The Batch mode is run with save parameters on a directory of Microtubule time-lapse images. 

If the user wants to run the program in Simple or Advanced Mode they have to also upload the image file and optionally a pre-processed image file. If the pre-processed image file is not uploaded this step will be carried out by the tracker internally. Pre-processed image is very crucial as the first part of the tracker is object recognition where it locates the Microtubules in the image. The recommended preprocessing for the tracker is flat-field correction followed by Median filter. The user also has to enter the SigmaX and SigmaY of the Point-Spread-Function (PSF) of the microscope used to image the Microtubules. 

=== Pre-Processing ===
If the user intends to upload their own preprocessed image it is recommended to do a flat field correction. To do this correction in Fiji, open your image and duplicate it by selecting {{bc | Image | Duplicate}} from the Fiji menu and click Duplicate Stack.
