== Description ==
MTrack is a tool, which detects, tracks, and measures the behavior of fluorescently labeled microtubules imaged by TIRF (total internal reflection fluorescence) microscopy. In such an in vitro reconstitution approach, stabilized, non-dynamic microtubule seeds serve as nucleation points for dynamically growing microtubules.

MTrack is a tri-modular tool. The first module detects and tracks the growing microtubule ends and creates trajectories. The second module uses these trajectories to fit models of dynamic behavior
(polymerization and depolymerization velocities, catastrophe and rescue frequencies). The third module computes statistics such as length and lifetime distributions when analyzing more than one
movie (batch mode).

== Module 1 - Microtubule Detection & Tracking==
A typical data set consists of a single two-dimensional (2d) image of the non-dynamic microtubule seeds followed by a 2d time-lapse of the dynamically growing microtubules (Note1). The file format
can be any format readable by Fiji/Bioformats (.tif, .nd2, … ). To run the tracker select {{bc|Plugins|MTrack|Tracking}}
The welcome panel will open.

===Choose Mode===
For a first analysis of your data, we suggest using the simple mode, in which we have pre-selected a number of parameters. In case you are unsatisfied with the outcome of the tracking you can use the
advanced mode to fine-tune settings. When analyzing more than one movie, you can select batch mode and run many movies simultaneously. However, before running the program in batch mode, you
have to at least run the program once in single or advanced mode to select and save the required parameters. The following intro is on simple mode, see here for advanced or batch mode.

===Select Movie===

Next, the user selects the movie.
Please note that detection might work better on flat-field corrected images. Optionally, we offer to approximate a flat-field correction based on the image data itself (Read more about Preprocessing).
For the movie type chooses one of the three supported options:
* Two channel image as hyper stack (both channels in one image)
* Concatenated seed image followed by time-lapse images
* Single channel time-lapse images
Please choose an output file name and directory. The trajectory files will be written as .txt files. By default trajectories will be saved in the current working directory with the name of the image.

===Microscope Parameters===
The program automatically reads the meta data shown as pixel size (micrometer in x and y) and frame rate (in seconds). If the metadata could not be read properly, the user can change the values. In addition, the user is asked to enter the Sigma(X) and Sigma(Y) of the Point-Spread-Function (PSF) of the microscope in pixel units (Note 2). For your convenience, our software comes with an inbuilt PSF analyzer tool, which
can optionally determine the PSF of your microscope from bead images by fitting a Gaussian function.

===Preprocessing===
Since initial microtubule detection might be disturbed by noise we suggest a preprocessing using median filtering (e.g. r=2 pixels) for the initial detection step by MSER/Watershed based Hough Transform.
Please note that this blurring will not be used during subsequent tracking. Press Next to proceed, and 3 screens and one panel will open. They show the original movie, the preprocessed movie, and the “active image”, which representing the seeds and is typically the first frame of the movie. Every successfully recognized seed will be marked with a red ellipse.
