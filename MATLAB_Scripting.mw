<h1>MATLAB tutorial for ImageJ</h1>

== Prerequisites ==

<ul>
<li>Enable the [http://fiji.sc/Update_Sites [[MATLAB]] Update Site] in Fiji</li>
<li>You will need to install your own licensed copy of [http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/ MATLAB]. All that is provided with Fiji are adapters for evaluating scripts written in Fiji to [[MATLAB]], and converters between ImageJ and [[MATLAB]] data structures.</li>
<li>If you've new to [[MATLAB]], first check out Mathworks' [http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/getting-started-with-matlab.html getting started guide].</li>
<li>If you're familiar with the [[MATLAB]] language but haven't written .m scripts before, look through the [http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/scripts.html script examples].</li>
</ul>

== Creating MATLAB scripts inside Fiji ==

<p>Using the [[Script Editor]] you will be able to select [[MATLAB]] from the [[Script_Editor#Choosing_a_language | language menu]]. You can also install and run .m scripts via the [[Scripting_Help#Creating_scripts_and_using_.22refresh_scripts.22 | standard script plugin infrastructure]].</p>

<p>Actually running a [[MATLAB]] script from Fiji is effectively like calling [http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/eval.html eval] on the script's contents. The script will be evaluated as such in a remote [[MATLAB]] instance (which will be launched automatically, if needed). Options for controlling the startup of [[MATLAB]], or killing existing [[MATLAB]] processes (e.g. if hidden) can be accessed via <code>Edit > Options > [[MATLAB]]...</code></p>

<p>NB: because the script is being passed from Fiji to a remote [[MATLAB]], [[MATLAB]] will not have access to Fiji's classpath. Objects can be passed as variables to [[MATLAB]] (e.g. by using @ annotation) but only if they are valid [[MATLAB]] classes or specially handled classes.</p>

<p>For example, by default all [http://matlabcontrol.googlecode.com/svn/javadocs/doc/matlabcontrol/extensions/MatlabNumericArray.html MatlabNumericArrays] will be converted to matrices within [[MATLAB]]. We also support auto-conversion of ImageJ Datasets out of the box, which can be read in by scripts using "@matrix" parameters:</p>

<source lang="matlab">
% @matrix data
% @OUTPUT double[] matrixSum
sum(data)
sum(ans)
matrixSum = sum(ans)
</source>

<p>
This script will take the active Dataset, set it as an array variable named "data" in [[MATLAB]], and set the matrixSum output value to the sum of the first three dimensions of the dataset. Scripts requiring Fiji/ImageJ classes without auto-conversion support should [[#Running Fiji within MATLAB | launch Fiji from within MATLAB]].
</p>

== Running Fiji within MATLAB ==

<p>The [http://fiji.sc/Miji Miji] project provides a [[MATLAB]] .m script that will start up a Fiji instance inside a running [[MATLAB]] application. The startup process automatically injects the full Fiji classpath into the [[MATLAB]] classpath, merging the two. At this point, you'll have a working Fiji and can now [[#Creating MATLAB scripts inside Fiji|run MATLAB scripts as normal]] with access to the full unified classpath.</p>

<p>Additionally, the {{GitHub|org=scijava|repo=scripting-matlab|label=Scripting-MATLAB}} library also includes an extensible [[MATLAB]] command framework. This allows for the creation of utility classes that will be automatically populated into [[MATLAB]] variables for easy access. For example, you could use Fiji to open a dataset and perform thresholding (or any other processing steps), then in [[MATLAB]] use the <code>IJM.importDataset</code> command to set the active dataset as a [[MATLAB]] matrix variable, for further analysis.</p>

== Importing classes ==

{{ImportingClasses|lang=MATLAB}}
<p>When running Fiji externally, [[MATLAB]] will not have Fiji/ImageJ classes in its classpath - so they can not simply be imported. Although [[MATLAB]] does support [http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/bringing-java-classes-and-methods-into-matlab-workspace.html editing its classpath] this is NOT recommended, as the classes loaded by [[MATLAB]] will not be the same as those loaded in Fiji.</p>

<p>Instead, you can [[#Running Fiji within MATLAB|launch Fiji inside MATLAB]] and have it take care of managing the class loading for you. [[MATLAB]] then supports the use of import statements to [http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/bringing-java-classes-and-methods-into-matlab-workspace.html#f46341 simplify class names].</p>
