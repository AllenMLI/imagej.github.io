The first step in stitching a tiled dataset is determining the pairwise shifts between the views. In the '''Stitching Mode''' select the views for the pairwise shift calculation. Then right-click and select {{bc|Stitching Wizard|Stitch dataset...}}. The '''Stitching wizard''' will guide you through the three steps of pairwise shift determination, link verification and global optimization. 

* If you just want to determine pairwise shifts and skip the other steps, you can use {{bc|Step-by-step Stitching|Calculate Pairwise Shifts...|Phase Correlation}}

* Now you can choose what instances of the grouped attributes should be used for the pairwise shift calculation. In this case the Views are grouped by Channel and Illumination. For the channels the average of all channels will be used as well as for the illuminations.

* Choose the the downsampling in x,y,z to the used for the calculation. Select a predefined downsampling factor or choose your own.

* Define the number of peaks to check and the minimal overlap between the tiles. Also choose if subpixel accuracy should be used and if previous pairwise shift calculations should be deleted.
