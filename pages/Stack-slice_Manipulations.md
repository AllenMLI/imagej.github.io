## Slice shuffling/removing/Adding

The slices in a stack can be manipulated in many ways. Some of these
functions are described below.

Deleting a single slice: “*Image/Stacks/Delete Slice*"

  - Deletes the currently displayed slice in a stack.

Deleting a number of slices: “*Image/Stacks/Tools/Slice remover*”

  - Indicate the first and last slices in the range to remove, as well
    as the increment of slices to remove between the first and last
    slices.

Select the slices to remove: “*Image/Stacks/Tools/Make substack*”

  - Indicate a range or list of slices to include in new substack;
    increments are possible.
  - Option to delete the slices from the original stack.

Stack to images/Images to stack: “*Image/Stacks/Stack to images” (Images
to Stack…)*.

  - “*Images to Stack*” requires images to be the same size. If
    different sized images are used, you will be presented with options
    to make the size uniform.
  - When using "Images to Stack", the original images will close once
    the stack is formed.

Montage: "*Image/Stack/Make Montage…*"

  - Many settings are self explanatory.
  - Ideal for generating a montage of a stack for a lab book.
  - Can do reverse operation with "*Image/Stack/Tools/Montage to
    Stack*", but will need to specify the number of rows and columns to
    ensure the correct number of slices.

Reversing stack: “*Image/Stacks/Tools/Reverse*"

Concatenate: “*Image/Stacks/Tools/Concatenate*"

  - Stacks must be the same dimension and image type.
  - "Open as a 4D Image" option interprets separate stacks as belonging
    to a single 4D dataset. For example, concatenating two 25-slice
    stacks would result in a 25-slice stack with two different time
    points at each slice.

Stack Combine: “*Image/Stacks/Tools/Combine*”

  - Can choose which stack comes first
  - If the two stacks contain a different number of slices, the shorter
    will have blank slices appended to the end so they are the same
    length.

(De)Interleave: “*Image/Stacks/Tools/DeInterleave”* and “*/Interleave*”

  - Deinterleave will distribute slices between new stacks as indicated
    by the specified number of channels.
  - Interleave is the reverse process and may be applied to two stacks
    at a time.

Stack Inserter: “*Image/Stacks/Tools/Insert*"

  - Used with two stacks, one is the source and the other the
    destination.
  - Superimpose the source by specifying the X and Y coordinates for the
    location of the upper left hand corner.
  - No automatic resizing, so the smaller stack should not be used as
    the destination.

Stack Sorter: “*Image/Stacks/Tools/Stack Sorter*”.

  - Control the position of individual slices or groups of slices.
  - Advanced “Insert” functionality.

## Stack dimension manipulations

Images and stacks can be resized and rotated with native functions or
with the more sophisticated TransformJ set of plugins from Erik
Meijering. More details about each TransformJ plugin can be found on
[this
website.](http://www.imagescience.org/meijering/software/transformj/)

Evaluation of Convolution-Based Methods for Medical Image
Interpolation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11516706), *Medical
Image Analysis*, vol. 5, no. 2, June 2001, pp. 111-126.

An alternative method for cropping a stack is found with
"*Plugins/Stacks/Crop (3D)*" After selecting 'OK', you will be presented
with panels of the ZY and XZ planes, as well as the original stack,
where you can use the mouse to crop the stack in any of the three
directions.

## Zoomify plugin

The Zoomify plugin will generate a movie sequence such that the first
frame includes the whole image and the last is the user defined ROI at
100%. The first slice image is the whole of the original image, scaled
so that it fits into the framesize of the ROI. The intermediate images
are progressively scaled so that the last frame is 100%. The scale
factor is noted as the label slice in the stack.

To use this plugin, select an ROI which will become the final frame, but
do not apply the ROI using "*Edit/Draw*". After the ROI is selected, run
the plugin and you will be prompted for the desired number of frames in
the movie.

## Align slices in stack

The plugins StackReg (to align a stack) and TurboReg (to align more than
one image or stack) can be used for alignment and are found at
"*Plugins/Registration/StackReg or TurboReg*". StackReg takes a stack
with misaligned slices and aligns the slices with respect to the current
slice. Open the stack, scroll to the most centered slice and run the
plugin. The "Rigid body" method typically produces the best results for
microscopy images. The TurboReg plugin must be installed before using
StackReg.
