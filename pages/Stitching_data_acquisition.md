# Wiscan Data Acquisition

![Microscope setup](/images/pages/OWS_1.jpg "Microscope setup")"

1.  Make sure the image being used has been set up correctly:
    1.  On the computer, click and hold the shutter button until it
        turns yellow. The shutter is now activated
    2.  Ensure the the outer shutter lever is pointing towards "Lamp"
        and the inner shutter lever is pointing to the right
    3.  Turn on the xyz controller
    <!-- end list -->
      - NOTE: Do not attempt to adjust the focus of the image with the
        manual knob while the controller is engaged. You will wear down
        the gears.
        </ol>
2.  Move the outer shutter lever toward "Image" and the inner shutter
    lever toward
3.  Turn on the Pockel Power Cell
4.  Turn on the Ti Sapph Shutter Controller
5.  Log in to Wiscan
6.  Turn on the detector

<!-- end list -->

  - Note: DO NOT turn on the detector till the main lights are off. You
    WILL damage the detector.

<li>

Start Scan and ensure your image is in focus on the left side of your
screen\<\\li\>

<li>

Use the computer xyz controller to choose your initial image frame

</li>

<li>

Adjust the pockle cell dials until you can see an image on the right
side of your screen (the blue portion)

</li>

<li>

Adjust the detector so that only a small amount of red can be seen in
the frame of your image. If too much of a contrast is present, it will
burn out the microscope's laser

</li>

  - Note: The normal range for the detector is 300-500. You should not
    go above 620.

 

<li>

Stop scan

</li>

 

<li>

Define the start position in your metadata by selecting "manual update"
then "set 0"

</li>

 

<li>

Generate the specifics of your image acquisition using generate grid

</li>

<li>

Set the size of each image taken (in microns)

</li>

<li>

Set the amount of overlap you wish to have in your image, then press
"calculate number of positions"

</li>

  - NOTE- You can also set your own step size and overlap amount and
    calculate the size of each image

<li>

Once you have calculated all the necessary positions, you can save this
data using the "save positions" button and load them back into Wiscan at
a later date

</li>

<li>

Select Z motor

</li>

<li>

under 4d imaging, calculate Z bottom, Z top, and Z step

</li>

<li>

These numbers should be set as 0 unless you are imaging in more than one
plane of your sample

</li>

<li>

Select "Use XY coordinates" and then start sequence

</li>

<li>

Once Wiscan has run, your output will be a series of images that can be
stitched together.

</li>

  - NOTE- If an noticeable amount of overlay can be seen in your images,
    there is a pixel to micron error within the microscope's initial
    setup. To fix this, recalibrate the microscope's objectives. 

## Generate the grid

![BasicGrid.png](/images/pages/BasicGrid.png "BasicGrid.png")"

### The basic grid

1.  Fill in the Dimensions of X and Y in \#X and \#Y respectively

![OverlappedGrid.png](/images/pages/OverlappedGrid.png "OverlappedGrid.png")"

<li>

Enter the step size in microns

</li>

<li>

Select "Calculate total size from \# Pos" to find the total size of your
stitched image (optional)

</li>

<li>

Select "OK"

</li>

</ol>

### Percent overlapped grid

1.  Use the "Compute overlap slider" to set the overlap percentage you
    would like within your stitched image
2.  Enter your dimensions for X and Y \<\\li\>
3.  Select "Calculate total size from \# Pos" to find the total size of
    your stitched image (optional)
4.  Select "OK"

### Calculating grid using total sample size

![SampleSize.png](/images/pages/SampleSize.png "SampleSize.png")"

1.  Enter the total size dimensions of your stitched image in microns
    into the "Total Size" boxes
2.  Enter the step size or the overlap for you stitched images and
    select "Calculate total size from \# Pos"
3.  Select "OK"

### Computing the grid between two stage positions

1.  Determine your step size using either a pre-calculated value or the
    overlap slider

![StageGrid.png](/images/pages/StageGrid.png "StageGrid.png")"

<li>

During your scan, use the XY motor controller to position on corner of
your tissue into the field of view

</li>

<li>

Select "Set current pos at START corner"

</li>

<li>

Select "OK"

</li>

</ol>
