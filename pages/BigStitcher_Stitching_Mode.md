After opening a XML file the main windows will appear in the **Stitching Mode**. In this mode all necessary steps for image stitching are performed

### The main window

![BigStitcher\_Overview\_1.png](/images/pages/BigStitcher_Overview_1.png "BigStitcher_Overview_1.png")

  - At the top of the window **(1)**, you can switch between Stitching and MultiView mode.

<!-- end list -->

  - Also at the top of the window **(2)** the name of the currently open .XML will appear. **Info** shows extended information of all Views in the current XML file. The **Save** button saves all current changes done to the XML.

<!-- end list -->

  - In the center of the window a list **(3)** shows all available views for the selected Timepoint and Angle.

<!-- end list -->

  - The views can be grouped by different attributes **(5)**. In this case views are grouped by Channels and Illuminations.

<!-- end list -->

  - In Stitching mode, only one Timepoint and Angle is displayed. Different Timepoints or Angles are accesed by the drop-down menu at the bottom **(4)**.

### The BigDataViewer window

If the dataset is in a format suitable for quick visualization by [BigDataViewer](BigDataViewer "wikilink") (e.g. multiresolution HDF5 or virtually loading), a BigDataViewer window in which selected Views can be visualized will open along with the BigStitcher main window. For other datasets, you can open BigDataViewer manually via the menu.

### The right-click menu

Select the views you wish to process in the main window and right-click to open a menu with further options.

  - **Displaying (1)** shows functions for displaying the data in BigDataViewer or in ImageJ ([details](BigStitcher_BDV "wikilink")).
  - **Preprocessing (2)** shows functions for manually moving views ([details](BigStitcher_manual_translation "wikilink")), selecting the best illuminations ([details](BigStitcher_Select_illumination "wikilink")) and performing flat-field correction ([details](BigStitcher_Flatfield_correction "wikilink")).
  - **Stitching Wizard (3)** shows functions that guide you through the stitching process.
  - **Step-by-step Stitching (4)** shows functions to execute the individual steps of the stitching process, [Pairwise shift calculation](BigStitcher_Pairwise_shift "wikilink"), [Link Preview and Verification](BigStitcher_Preview_Pairwise_shift "wikilink") and [Global Optimization](BigStitcher_Global_optimization "wikilink").

There are also several advanced expert functions for the individual steps in the stitching pipeline ([details](BigStitcher_Advanced_stitching "wikilink")).

  - **Registration Refinement (5)** shows functions for refining the alignment via ICP ([details](BigStitcher_ICP_refinement "wikilink"))
  - **Fusion (6)** shows functions for the fusion of views (or parts thereof) into single output images ([details](BigStitcher_Fuse "wikilink")).
  - **Calibration/Transformations (7)** shows functions for removing transformations from the dataset.
  - **Modifications (8)** shows functions for resaving the dataset, e.g. as multiresolution HDF5 ([details](BigStitcher_AutoLoader#Options_for_re-saving_as_HDF5 "wikilink")).
  - **Help (9)** contains a link to this documentation.
