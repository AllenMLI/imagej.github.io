By request of Daniel James White, we now have Colocalization plugins in [Fiji](Fiji "wikilink"). We took two plugins from the [MBF Plugin Collection](MBF_Plugin_Collection "wikilink"), fixed them to work with newer [ImageJ](ImageJ "wikilink") versions, and put them into the Fiji [Updater](Updater "wikilink"). Oh, and of course, they are {% include github org='fiji' repo='Colocalisation\_Analysis' %}, too.
