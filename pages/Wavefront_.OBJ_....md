This plugin will threshold a stack and create a surface using
marchingcubes, and then save that as a Wavefront .OBJ file.

There is an option to export surfaces in this format from the [3D
Viewer](3D_Viewer "wikilink") but this option may still be useful for
you in the following situations:

  - If the 3D Viewer doesn't work for you (or is very slow)
  - If you are using Fiji's --headless option
