\_\_NOTOC\_\_ Software in the **public domain** disclaims all copyright
interest, being freely available to everyone for any purpose, with no
attribution or acknowledgement required. There are several ways
(summarized below) to dedicate software to the public domainâ€”although be
warned that some jurisdictions do not recognize the legal concept of
"public domain" at all.

See the [Wikipedia article on public domain
software](wikipedia:Public_domain_software "wikilink") for more
information.
