The [Rand index](wikipedia:Rand_index "wikilink") is a well-known measure of the similarity between two data clusterings\[1\]. Recently, it has been proposed as a **measure of segmentation performance**, since a segmentation can be regarded as a clustering of pixels\[2\]. More formally, define a segmentation as an integer-valued labeling of an image. Each object in a segmentation consists of a set of pixels sharing a common label.

The [Rand index](wikipedia:Rand_index "wikilink") is defined as a measure of agreement:

Given two segmentations \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) of an image \(I\) with \(n\) pixels, we define:

  - \(a\), the number of pairs of pixels in \(I\) that are in the same object in \(S_1\) and in the same object in \(S_2\) (i.e., they have the same label)

<!-- end list -->

  - \(b\), the number of pairs of pixels in \(I\) that are in different objects in \(S_1\) and in different objects in \(S_2\) (i.e., they have different labels)

The Rand index, \(RI\), is:

\[RI = \frac{a+b}{{n \choose 2 }}\]

Here we instead define the closely related [Rand error](Rand_error "wikilink"), which is a measure of disagreement. The [Rand error](Rand_error "wikilink") (RE) is the **frequency with which the two segmentations disagree over whether a pair of pixels belongs to same or different objects**:

\[RE = 1 - RI\]

## Implementation in Fiji

The [Rand error](Rand_error "wikilink") metric is implemented in the [Trainable Weka Segmentation](Trainable_Weka_Segmentation "wikilink") library. Here is an example of how to use it in a [Beanshell script](Beanshell_Scripting "wikilink"):

``` java
import trainableSegmentation.metrics.RandError;
import ij.IJ;

// original labels
originalLabels = IJ.openImage("/path/original-labels.tif");

// proposed (new) labels
proposedLabels = IJ.openImage("/path/proposed-labels.tif");

// threshold to binarize labels
threshold = 0.5;

metric = new RandError( originalLabels, proposedLabels );
randError = metric.getMetricValue( threshold );

IJ.log("Rand error between source image " + originalLabels.getTitle() + " and target image "
+ proposedLabels.getTitle() + " = " + randError); 
```
