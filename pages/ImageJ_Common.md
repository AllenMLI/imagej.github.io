The ImageJ Common library contains ImageJ's core image data model, based
on the [ImgLib2](ImgLib2 "wikilink") library for multidimensional image
data processing, as well as the corresponding core image display logic
for user interfaces, based on the [SciJava
Common](SciJava_Common "wikilink") application framework.

Java 8 make the process very smooth Much better than few years ago :-0 |

Using [ImgLib2](ImgLib2 "wikilink") offers several benefits:

  - Support for many different data types (different combinations of bit
    depths, signedness, and integer/real representations).
  - Support for large datasets (many planes/cubes/etc., large
    planes/cubes/etc.).
  - Abstraction of the underlying image storage mechanism (file on disk,
    data in memory, remote URL, remote database, etc.).

ImageJ Common is still in beta, with significant changes still planned
for its central class hierarchies.

At the time of this writing, the central image data structures are:

  - 
{% capture includecontent %} package = net/imglib2/meta | class =
ImgPlus {% endcapture %}

{% include javadoc content=includecontent %}

  - 
{% capture includecontent %} package = net/imagej | class = Dataset {%
endcapture %}

{% include javadoc content=includecontent %}

`andÂ `

{% capture includecontent %} package = net/imagej | class =
DefaultDataset {% endcapture %}

{% include javadoc content=includecontent %}
