{% include Learn content="languages" %} A thin wrapper around
[Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) is currently available on the {%
include ListOfUpdateSites content="Java 8 update site" %}, providing
Scala scripting capabilities in ImageJ. However, support is *very new*
and *largely untested*. Support will be improved later, as time allows.

See also {% include GitHub content="org=scijava | repo=scripting-scala |
label=scripting-scala on GitHub" %}.
