This page should be used internally to discuss the new IJ user guide
layout. Once polished, it should serve to orient on when converting old
user guide sections or preparing new sections to end up with a uniform
layout.

The syntax is always shown in the gray boxes and the actual look you
will see directly below each syntax specification.

If you want to add other templates, here you can find the ones existing
on imagej.net: [Template
pages](https://imagej.net/index.php?title=Special%3AAllPages&from=&to=&namespace=10)
