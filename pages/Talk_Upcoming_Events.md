## Remove the "Other info" column?

Is the "Other info" useful? Most of those things should be linked from the main site, right? I'd rather keep only one central link to the event's front page, because:

  - It makes the table less wide.
  - It is easier to maintain, and avoids some future broken links.
  - It eliminates the burden of deciding which info is important enough to reside there.

Thoughts?

no worries... we can remove it. I was motivated to include that mainly for the satellite workshop for the ABRF meeting... but you are right - less is more (and easier to maintain) I'll remove it now.
