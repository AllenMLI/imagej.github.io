The source code of ImageJ is very modular; i.e., it is organized into [well-separated](Architecture#Modularity "wikilink") projects. This separation offers many advantages for efficient software development and it is well worth investing a little bit of time to understand.

## Where is the code?

{% include tip tip='You can search the source code at http://search.imagej.net/ using the GitHub button\!' %}\* All source code is on [GitHub](GitHub "wikilink").

  - Each project exists in its own GitHub organization.
  - Each organization contains multiple source code repositories.
  - Each repository corresponds to one Java library (.jar file).

See the [Architecture](Architecture "wikilink") page for more information about the relationship between these projects.

## What is the license?

Most is [BSD-2](BSD-2 "wikilink") (permissive); some is [GPL](GPL "wikilink") (copyleft). See the [Licensing](Licensing "wikilink") page.

## Building from source

Virtually all of these repositories have a top-level `pom.xml` file, identifying them as [Maven](Maven "wikilink") projects.

To build a Maven project:

1.  [Install Maven](http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html).
2.  Clone the source repository of interest.
3.  Type `mvn` from the top-level directory.

Advanced instructions for building, or modifying, the source code are available for specific development environments: {% include ides%}
 Note that these tutorials are targeted towards [ImageJ](ImageJ "wikilink"), but would apply to any Maven-based project.

## Running ImageJ1 unit tests

We have written a substantial number of unit tests to exercise [ImageJ 1.x](ImageJ_1.x "wikilink") functionality. See the [Unit tests for ImageJ1](Unit_tests_for_ImageJ1 "wikilink") page for more information.
