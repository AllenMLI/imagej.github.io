# Tracing

These instructions assume that you have read the
[Overview](SNT:_Overview "wikilink") page, including starting up the
plugin, enabling [Cursor
Auto-snapping](SNT:_Overview#Auto-snapping "wikilink"), and
[Auto-tracing](SNT:_Overview#Auto-tracing "wikilink") options.

## Starting A Path

### I. Pick The Starting Point

![Choosing a starting point](Snt-cropped-before-starting-2.png
"Choosing a starting point") You may notice that, by default, the cursor
[snaps](SNT:_Overview#Auto-snapping "wikilink") to the brightest pixel
in its vicinity. If you prefer to manually control the placement of
nodes, feel free to toggle feature by pressing . Now, to begin tracing,
move through the image stack to find the start point of a path then
click there with the left mouse button.

### II. Pick A Subsequent Point

![First point of a path selected](Snt-cropped-after-starting-2.png
"First point of a path selected") ![A\* search animated
progress](Snt-cropped-mid-tracing-2.png "A* search animated progress") A
small circle should appear, highlighting the start of the path. Move
through the stack to find a subsequent point further along the same
structure to be traced (neuron, blood vessel, etc.), and click there.

If a path between the two points cannot be found immediately, you may
see the animated progress of the search. You can scroll through the
stack while such a search progresses: If it appears to not be making
good progress, it's probably best to press the "Cancel/Esc" button
(shortcut: /) and pick a point closer to the start point. 

### III. Confirm The Temporary Segment

Once the search has reached the target point, the path is shown in cyan
(to indicate that this is still a temporary path) and you are asked to
confirm (by clicking "Yes" or pressing ) that this path is following the
route through the image that you expect. If it is not, then click "No" 
and you'll go back to the [previous
step](#II._Picking_a_Subsequent_Point "wikilink"). Assuming you
confirmed the path, the confirmed path will appear in red. Now you are
essentially back at [step
II](#II._Picking_a_Subsequent_Point "wikilink"). Normally you will go on
to pick further points along the structure. However, if you have
finished with that path, click "Finish Path"  and you will go back to
[step I](#I._Picking_a_Start_Point "wikilink"). If you completed that
path it would be shown in magenta.

<div align="center">

  - ![A\* search completed](Snt-cropped-confirmation-2.png
    "A* search completed")
  - ![A confirmed segment](Snt-cropped-confirmed-2.png
    "A confirmed segment")
  - ![A completed path](Snt-cropped-completed-path-2.png
    "A completed path")

</div>

## Branching: Start A Path On An Existing Path

### I. Select The Path To Branch Off

To select the path you want to branch off from, you can either select it
in the Path Manager, or press  while the mouse pointer is near the path.
When the path is first selected, it will be shown in the default green
color. ![[Holding 'G'](SNT:_Key_Shortcuts#Path_Handling "wikilink") will
select the closest path to the mouse pointer](Snt-sb-selecting-by-G.gif
"Holding 'G' will select the closest path to the mouse pointer")

### II. Select The Fork Point

![A newly created fork point](Snt-sb-started-branch-2.png
"A newly created fork point") To force the start of the new path to be a
branch of the selected path, hold down the  keys while you move the
mouse to find the branch point under the red cross-hairs, now decorated
with a "Fork Point" annotation. With  held down, click with the left
mouse button. Finally, release the keys. Note that it is also possible
to zoom into the branch point, right-click on the image and choose *Fork
at Nearest Node* from the contextual menu.

### III. Extend The Path

From this point on, you can carry on adding nodes to the branched path
as [above](#II._Pick_A_Subsequent_Point "wikilink"), i.e., Create a
temporary path and confirm it. When you decide to complete the path you
should see in the Path Manager that it has been recorded as a child of
the existing path.

## Joining: End A Path On An Existing Path

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Supposing you want the end of a path that you're tracing to join onto an existing path, you just use the same modifier key when selecting the end point of the last part of the path. To go into that in more detail, if you're halfway through tracing a path like \[1\]:                                         | ![<span style="text-align:center;font-size:90%">\[1\] Unfinished join segment, in red - disconnected</span>](Snt-ej-cropped-half-finished-2.png "[1] Unfinished join segment, in red - disconnected") |
| ... and you want the final part of that path to join up with the existing path running from the top-left to top-right of the image. First, select that path in the path list (or using the  shortcut) as in \[2\]:                                                                                                 | ![<span style="text-align:center;font-size:90%">\[2\] Selected path to join to, in green</span>](Snt-ej-cropped-selected-destination-path-2.png "[2] Selected path to join to, in green")             |
| Now hold down  to restrict the endpoint to be a "join" on that existing path. Click (while still holding down the modifier keys) to start the search for that endpoint and make it join the existing path. If the search can find a path to the end point, the result should look like \[3\]:                      | ![<span style="text-align:center;font-size:90%">\[3\] Connected path to join, unconfirmed</span>](Snt-ej-cropped-end-join-created-2.png "[3] Connected path to join, unconfirmed")                    |
| If you're happy with the result, confirming the temporary path will automatically complete the whole path, since if you're creating an end join there cannot be any more to the path. Note that the path list indicates that this new *Path (1)* ends on the existing *Path (0)*. The result will look like \[4\]: | ![<span style="text-align:center;font-size:90%">\[4\] Confirmed join</span>](Snt-ej-cropped-path-completed-2.png "[4] Confirmed join")                                                                |

## Merging/Joining Paths

Two paths can be merged or joined in *Edit Mode*. To do so:

1.  Select a path and enter *Edit Mode* (by right-clicking on the image
    canvas to access its [Contextual
    menu](SNT:_Overview#Contextual_Menu "wikilink"))
2.  Activate the node to be merged by hovering over it
3.  Select the second path by using the 
    [shortcut](SNT:_Key_Shortcuts "wikilink") and activate the second
    merging node by hovering over it
4.  Open the contextual menu and select the initial path from the
    *Connect To (Start Join)* / *Connect To (End Join)* menu.

If both nodes are terminal, the paths are merged together. Otherwise,
one path will become a child of the other. Note that one of the nodes
must be terminal, to ensure no loops are created.

<div align="center">

  - ![1) Select parent path and activate first join
    node](SNT-Edit-Path-Connect-To-Step-1.png

  - ![2) Select child path and activate second join
    node](SNT-Edit-Path-Connect-To-Step-2.png

## Tracing in the Legacy 3D Viewer

It remains possible to trace in the legacy 3D Viewer.
![](SNT-3D-Dialog.png)

### I.Starting the Viewer

To open the viewer, select the *3D* menu tab in the SNT dialog and look
for *Legacy 3D Viewer*. You will see 3 parameters:
![SNT-Image-Resampling-Factor.png](SNT-Image-Resampling-Factor.png
"SNT-Image-Resampling-Factor.png")

  - Select *New with image* from the *Viewer* drop-down menu (selecting
    *New without image* would only allow you to look at reconstructions
    without the underlying signal). Note that you can recycle existing
    viewers you may have open by choosing their window titles from the
    drop-down menu.
  - Select the preferred rendering style from the *Mode* drop-down menu.
  - Once you *Apply* the viewer choice, a prompt will appear asking you
    to choose the resampling factor for the image. Then, the viewer
    window will appear with the currently open image.

![3D viewer showing OP\_1.tif](SNT-Legacy-3D-Viewer.png
"3D viewer showing OP_1.tif")

### II.Tracing and Navigation

  - **Selecting points for tracing** Select the *Wand tool* (
    [shortcut](SNT:_Key_Shortcuts#Legacy_3D_Viewer "wikilink")) in the
    main ImageJ toolbar and click over the region you want to trace.
    Tracing works the same way as in the 2.5D view, i.e., click
    somewhere in the image to create a starting point, then click
    further along the structure of interest to find a path between the
    two points, then confirm or deny the temporary segment as described
    [above](#Tracing "wikilink"). Similarly, branching occurs as
    [described for 2D
    canvas(es)](#Branching:_Start_A_Path_On_An_Existing_Path "wikilink"),
    by holding the  modifier.
  - **Rotation** Either use the *Hand tool* (
    [shortcut](SNT:_Key_Shortcuts#Legacy_3D_Viewer "wikilink")) tool and
    left-click while dragging the mouse or drag mouse while holding the
    scroll wheel.
  - **Translation** Hold  and the scroll wheel while dragging the mouse.
  - **Adjusting zoom depth** Scroll the mouse wheel.

Once you have selected each of these tools (Wand and Hand) once, you
should be able to switch between them by pressing the  key. See [Key
Shortcuts](SNT:_Key_Shortcuts#Legacy_3D_Viewer "wikilink") for the list
of all supported shortcuts.

# Filling

There is a simple facility in this plugin for "filling out" paths to
volumes. This is not particularly sophisticated, but often good enough
for a rough visualization of the shape of a neuron beyond what can be
seen from the traced path.

### I.Starting the Fill

First, select the one or more paths that you want to fill out from in
the Path Manager and select "Fill -\> Fill Out..." in the Path Manager
menu options. The selected paths are shown in green so that you can
check that you're starting from the right ones. After a couple of
seconds if you scroll through the stack you should be able to see a
thick green surround the path:

![A few seconds after selecting "Fill Out..." with 1 path
selected](Snt-initial-filling-2.png
"A few seconds after selecting \"Fill Out...\" with 1 path selected")

The filler continues to explore the image starting from the path until
you click "Pause" or "Stop" in the dialog. However, the fill which is
shown only includes those points up to a certain threshold distance from
the path. (Note that in this section "distance" doesn't mean a real
physical distance, but a measure which takes into account the intensity
values of the pixels which must be passed through when moving away from
the path.) Information about the current threshold and the progress of
the search is shown in the dialog. ![The filling-related part of the
dialog.](Snt-filling-statistics-2.png
"The filling-related part of the dialog.") The "Cursor position:" state
under "Search Status" is updated as you move your mouse over the image.
If the point under the mouse has been reached by the search then it will
show you that point's distance from the path. Otherwise, it will read
"Not reached by search yet". Two lines above, the "Current threshold
distance:" shows your current threshold distance: so if this is set to
0.2 then that means that all points less than 0.2 from the path are
included in the fill (and shown in green in the image.) The "Max.
explored distance:" state under this line shows the maximum distance
from the path that has been completely explored.

### II.Adjusting the Fill Threshold

You can change the fill threshold in one of three ways:

  - Clicking on a point in the image that has been reached by the search
    (This is the most intuitive way of altering the threshold). It may
    be helpful to disable the "Enable Snapping within: XY-Z" feature for
    the cursor while doing this.
  - Manually changing the threshold in the "Specify manually:" input box
    and clicking the "Apply" button beside it.
  - Clicking the "Use explored maximum" button below the threshold input
    box and click "Apply", which sets the threshold to the maximum
    explored distance (the value shown in "Max. explored distance:"
    under the "Search Status" dialog).

Anyway, assuming that you want to use the first of these approaches, you
should use the approach described below. It is difficult to set the
threshold accurately from the image unless you zoom in, so first zoom on
part of the path that you want to set the threshold for.

Since the solid green fill obscures the intensity value of the points in
the fill, I suggest that you switch to the semi-transparent view of the
fill at this stage by selecting the "Transparent overlay" option in the
"Rendering Options" dialog. Note that this may slow down filling.

As you can see in the middle image, the threshold is set too far from
the path, since there are many completely dark points under the green
fill, as well as points on different paths than those of interest.
Experiment with clicking on different points closer to the path in order
to adjust the threshold until you are happy with it. You might end up
with something like the rightmost image:

<div align="center">

  - ![Fill, opaque](Snt-zoomed-filling-2.png "Fill, opaque")
  - ![Fill, with "Transparent overlay" on](Snt-transparent-filling-2.png
    "Fill, with \"Transparent overlay\" on")
  - ![Fill, refined](Snt-refined-filling-2.png "Fill, refined")

</div>

### III.Completing the Fill

If you are happy with this, then you might as well click "Pause" so that
your computer isn't spending all its CPU on continuing to explore the
image. Then you can either:

  - Save the fill (which will add it to the fill list) by clicking
    "Stash Progress".
  - Discard the fill by either clicking "Stop" while filling is in
    progress or, if you stashed the fill, select it in the fill list and
    click "Delete Fill(s)".
  - Use the "Image Stack..." button to view the same image stack, but
    with only the points in that fill preserved. You can choose either a
    grayscale image or a binary mask. One reason why you might want to
    do this is that you can then smooth that image and use the [3D
    Viewer](3D_Viewer "wikilink") to do a surface rendering of the
    neuron. Perhaps then you could overlay that onto a volume rendering
    of the complete image (see available
    [tutorials](Simple_Neurite_Tracer#Tutorials "wikilink")). Or, you
    could save those fill stacks for each of the neurons you fill and
    then combine them in ImageJ using "RGB Merge".

The image stack you would get from the image used in this example might
look something like this: ![Having selected the "Image Stack... -\> As
Grayscale Image..." option](Snt-filling-viewed-2.png
"Having selected the \"Image Stack... -\> As Grayscale Image...\" option")

# Generating *Filtered Images*

This section describes how to generate [Filtered
Images](SNT:_Overview#Tracing_on_Filtered_Image "wikilink") outside SNT.
Note that the filtering used in this walk-through
(*[Frangi](Frangi "wikilink") Vesselness*) is already supported directly
by SNT. This tutorial will assume you need to perform the filtering with
adjusted parameters.

#### A Single Image

To process a single image with the Frangi Vesselness filter, pause SNT,
and select . By way of example, let's say you need to enhance strucutres
at two scales: twice the x voxel separation and five times that value.
We apply a Gaussian convolution at each scale. Assuming your image has
isotropic resolution with pixel width = pixel height = voxel depth = 1,
the parameters would be: ![](frangi-parameters.png)  Save the result
using  ("test-filtered.tif", for example). Then, in SNT's dialog look
for the "Tracing on Secondary Image" widget in the *Main* tab. Click the
file folder button to specify the secondary image. Next, toggle the
"Trace on Secondary Image" checkbox (you can do so using . Now the
pathfinding will occur on the secondary image. To view a MIP of the
secondary image "over" the original image during tracing, toggle the
"Render in overlay at X% opacity" checkbox.

<div align="center">

  - ![Step 1](filtered-image-load.png "Step 1")
  - ![Step 2](filtered-image-toggle.png "Step 2")

</div>

To display the image in a separate window, from the SNT dialog use  from
the *gear* menu or . ![Secondary Image Overlay at 50%
Opacity](display-filtered-image.png
"Secondary Image Overlay at 50% Opacity")

#### Multiple Images

The easiest way to preprocess multiple images is to record a macro for
processing a single image, then wrap it in a loop to iterate over all
files in a directory. For example, using IJ1 macro language:

``` java
d = getDirectory("Select a directory");
files = getFileList(d);
 
extension = ".tif";
 
for( i = 0; i < files.length; ++i ) {
    filename = files[i];
    if( endsWith(filename,extension) ) {
        l = lengthOf(filename);
        el = lengthOf(extension);
        basename = substring(filename,0,l-el);
        expected_window_name = "result";
        output_filename = d + File.separator + basename + ".tubes.tif";
        open(filename);
        run("Frangi Vesselness"); // arguments can be specified here
        selectWindow(expected_window_name);
        saveAs("Tiff", output_filename);
    }
}
```

The same process can be accomplished in a script using [ImageJ
Ops](ImageJ_Ops "wikilink"). For example, in Jython:

``` python
# @ImageJ ij
# @String(value="<HTML>This script applies the Frangi Vesselness filter to all TIFF images in a directory.<br>Only 2D or 3D grayscale images are supported. Processing log is shown in Console.", visibility="MESSAGE") msg
# @File(label="Directory containing your images", style="directory") input_dir
# @String(label="Consider only filenames containing",description="Clear field for no filtering",value="") name_filter
# @boolean(label="Include subdirectories") recursive
# @float(label="Size of structures to be filtered (spatially calibrated units)",description="The filter kernel will be determined from the average voxel size") scale
# @LogService log
# @StatusService status
# @UIService uiservice

# Tracing

These instructions assume that you have read the
[Overview](SNT:_Overview "wikilink") page, including starting up the
plugin, enabling [Cursor
Auto-snapping](SNT:_Overview#Auto-snapping "wikilink"), and
[Auto-tracing](SNT:_Overview#Auto-tracing "wikilink") options.

## Starting A Path

### I. Pick The Starting Point

![Choosing a starting point](Snt-cropped-before-starting-2.png
"Choosing a starting point") You may notice that, by default, the cursor
[snaps](SNT:_Overview#Auto-snapping "wikilink") to the brightest pixel
in its vicinity. If you prefer to manually control the placement of
nodes, feel free to toggle feature by pressing . Now, to begin tracing,
move through the image stack to find the start point of a path then
click there with the left mouse button.

### II. Pick A Subsequent Point

![First point of a path selected](Snt-cropped-after-starting-2.png
"First point of a path selected") ![A\* search animated
progress](Snt-cropped-mid-tracing-2.png "A* search animated progress") A
small circle should appear, highlighting the start of the path. Move
through the stack to find a subsequent point further along the same
structure to be traced (neuron, blood vessel, etc.), and click there.

If a path between the two points cannot be found immediately, you may
see the animated progress of the search. You can scroll through the
stack while such a search progresses: If it appears to not be making
good progress, it's probably best to press the "Cancel/Esc" button
(shortcut: /) and pick a point closer to the start point. 

### III. Confirm The Temporary Segment

Once the search has reached the target point, the path is shown in cyan
(to indicate that this is still a temporary path) and you are asked to
confirm (by clicking "Yes" or pressing ) that this path is following the
route through the image that you expect. If it is not, then click "No" 
and you'll go back to the [previous
step](#II._Picking_a_Subsequent_Point "wikilink"). Assuming you
confirmed the path, the confirmed path will appear in red. Now you are
essentially back at [step
II](#II._Picking_a_Subsequent_Point "wikilink"). Normally you will go on
to pick further points along the structure. However, if you have
finished with that path, click "Finish Path"  and you will go back to
[step I](#I._Picking_a_Start_Point "wikilink"). If you completed that
path it would be shown in magenta.

<div align="center">

  - ![A\* search completed](Snt-cropped-confirmation-2.png
    "A* search completed")
  - ![A confirmed segment](Snt-cropped-confirmed-2.png
    "A confirmed segment")
  - ![A completed path](Snt-cropped-completed-path-2.png
    "A completed path")

</div>

## Branching: Start A Path On An Existing Path

### I. Select The Path To Branch Off

To select the path you want to branch off from, you can either select it
in the Path Manager, or press  while the mouse pointer is near the path.
When the path is first selected, it will be shown in the default green
color. ![[Holding 'G'](SNT:_Key_Shortcuts#Path_Handling "wikilink") will
select the closest path to the mouse pointer](Snt-sb-selecting-by-G.gif
"Holding 'G' will select the closest path to the mouse pointer")

### II. Select The Fork Point

![A newly created fork point](Snt-sb-started-branch-2.png
"A newly created fork point") To force the start of the new path to be a
branch of the selected path, hold down the  keys while you move the
mouse to find the branch point under the red cross-hairs, now decorated
with a "Fork Point" annotation. With  held down, click with the left
mouse button. Finally, release the keys. Note that it is also possible
to zoom into the branch point, right-click on the image and choose *Fork
at Nearest Node* from the contextual menu.

### III. Extend The Path

From this point on, you can carry on adding nodes to the branched path
as [above](#II._Pick_A_Subsequent_Point "wikilink"), i.e., Create a
temporary path and confirm it. When you decide to complete the path you
should see in the Path Manager that it has been recorded as a child of
the existing path.

## Joining: End A Path On An Existing Path

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Supposing you want the end of a path that you're tracing to join onto an existing path, you just use the same modifier key when selecting the end point of the last part of the path. To go into that in more detail, if you're halfway through tracing a path like \[1\]:                                         | ![<span style="text-align:center;font-size:90%">\[1\] Unfinished join segment, in red - disconnected</span>](Snt-ej-cropped-half-finished-2.png "[1] Unfinished join segment, in red - disconnected") |
| ... and you want the final part of that path to join up with the existing path running from the top-left to top-right of the image. First, select that path in the path list (or using the  shortcut) as in \[2\]:                                                                                                 | ![<span style="text-align:center;font-size:90%">\[2\] Selected path to join to, in green</span>](Snt-ej-cropped-selected-destination-path-2.png "[2] Selected path to join to, in green")             |
| Now hold down  to restrict the endpoint to be a "join" on that existing path. Click (while still holding down the modifier keys) to start the search for that endpoint and make it join the existing path. If the search can find a path to the end point, the result should look like \[3\]:                      | ![<span style="text-align:center;font-size:90%">\[3\] Connected path to join, unconfirmed</span>](Snt-ej-cropped-end-join-created-2.png "[3] Connected path to join, unconfirmed")                    |
| If you're happy with the result, confirming the temporary path will automatically complete the whole path, since if you're creating an end join there cannot be any more to the path. Note that the path list indicates that this new *Path (1)* ends on the existing *Path (0)*. The result will look like \[4\]: | ![<span style="text-align:center;font-size:90%">\[4\] Confirmed join</span>](Snt-ej-cropped-path-completed-2.png "[4] Confirmed join")                                                                |

## Merging/Joining Paths

Two paths can be merged or joined in *Edit Mode*. To do so:

1.  Select a path and enter *Edit Mode* (by right-clicking on the image
    canvas to access its [Contextual
    menu](SNT:_Overview#Contextual_Menu "wikilink"))
2.  Activate the node to be merged by hovering over it
3.  Select the second path by using the 
    [shortcut](SNT:_Key_Shortcuts "wikilink") and activate the second
    merging node by hovering over it
4.  Open the contextual menu and select the initial path from the
    *Connect To (Start Join)* / *Connect To (End Join)* menu.

If both nodes are terminal, the paths are merged together. Otherwise,
one path will become a child of the other. Note that one of the nodes
must be terminal, to ensure no loops are created.

<div align="center">

  - ![1) Select parent path and activate first join
    node](SNT-Edit-Path-Connect-To-Step-1.png
    "1) Select parent path and activate first join node")
  - ![2) Select child path and activate second join
    node](SNT-Edit-Path-Connect-To-Step-2.png
    "2) Select child path and activate second join node")
  - ![3) Use contextual-menu option to connect child path to parent
    path](SNT-Edit-Path-Connect-To-Step-3.png

  - ![4) Joined result

</div>

## Tracing in the Legacy 3D Viewer

It remains possible to trace in the legacy 3D Viewer.
![](SNT-3D-Dialog.png)

### I.Starting the Viewer

To open the viewer, select the *3D* menu tab in the SNT dialog and look
for *Legacy 3D Viewer*. You will see 3 parameters:
![SNT-Image-Resampling-Factor.png](SNT-Image-Resampling-Factor.png
"SNT-Image-Resampling-Factor.png")

  - Select *New with image* from the *Viewer* drop-down menu (selecting
    *New without image* would only allow you to look at reconstructions
    without the underlying signal). Note that you can recycle existing
    viewers you may have open by choosing their window titles from the
    drop-down menu.
  - Select the preferred rendering style from the *Mode* drop-down menu.
  - Once you *Apply* the viewer choice, a prompt will appear asking you
    to choose the resampling factor for the image. Then, the viewer
    window will appear with the currently open image.

![3D viewer showing OP\_1.tif](SNT-Legacy-3D-Viewer.png
"3D viewer showing OP_1.tif")

### II.Tracing and Navigation

  - **Selecting points for tracing** Select the *Wand tool* (
    [shortcut](SNT:_Key_Shortcuts#Legacy_3D_Viewer "wikilink")) in the
    main ImageJ toolbar and click over the region you want to trace.
    Tracing works the same way as in the 2.5D view, i.e., click
    somewhere in the image to create a starting point, then click
    further along the structure of interest to find a path between the
    two points, then confirm or deny the temporary segment as described
    [above](#Tracing "wikilink"). Similarly, branching occurs as
    [described for 2D
    canvas(es)](#Branching:_Start_A_Path_On_An_Existing_Path "wikilink"),
    by holding the  modifier.
  - **Rotation** Either use the *Hand tool* (
    [shortcut](SNT:_Key_Shortcuts#Legacy_3D_Viewer "wikilink")) tool and
    left-click while dragging the mouse or drag mouse while holding the
    scroll wheel.
  - **Translation** Hold  and the scroll wheel while dragging the mouse.
  - **Adjusting zoom depth** Scroll the mouse wheel.

Once you have selected each of these tools (Wand and Hand) once, you
should be able to switch between them by pressing the  key. See [Key
Shortcuts](SNT:_Key_Shortcuts#Legacy_3D_Viewer "wikilink") for the list
of all supported shortcuts.

# Filling

There is a simple facility in this plugin for "filling out" paths to
volumes. This is not particularly sophisticated, but often good enough
for a rough visualization of the shape of a neuron beyond what can be
seen from the traced path.

### I.Starting the Fill

First, select the one or more paths that you want to fill out from in
the Path Manager and select "Fill -\> Fill Out..." in the Path Manager
menu options. The selected paths are shown in green so that you can
check that you're starting from the right ones. After a couple of
seconds if you scroll through the stack you should be able to see a
thick green surround the path:

![A few seconds after selecting "Fill Out..." with 1 path
selected](Snt-initial-filling-2.png
"A few seconds after selecting \"Fill Out...\" with 1 path selected")

The filler continues to explore the image starting from the path until
you click "Pause" or "Stop" in the dialog. However, the fill which is
shown only includes those points up to a certain threshold distance from
the path. (Note that in this section "distance" doesn't mean a real
physical distance, but a measure which takes into account the intensity
values of the pixels which must be passed through when moving away from
the path.) Information about the current threshold and the progress of
the search is shown in the dialog. ![The filling-related part of the
dialog.](Snt-filling-statistics-2.png
"The filling-related part of the dialog.") The "Cursor position:" state
under "Search Status" is updated as you move your mouse over the image.
If the point under the mouse has been reached by the search then it will
show you that point's distance from the path. Otherwise, it will read
"Not reached by search yet". Two lines above, the "Current threshold
distance:" shows your current threshold distance: so if this is set to
0.2 then that means that all points less than 0.2 from the path are
included in the fill (and shown in green in the image.) The "Max.
explored distance:" state under this line shows the maximum distance
from the path that has been completely explored.

### II.Adjusting the Fill Threshold

You can change the fill threshold in one of three ways:

  - Clicking on a point in the image that has been reached by the search
    (This is the most intuitive way of altering the threshold). It may
    be helpful to disable the "Enable Snapping within: XY-Z" feature for
    the cursor while doing this.
  - Manually changing the threshold in the "Specify manually:" input box
    and clicking the "Apply" button beside it.
  - Clicking the "Use explored maximum" button below the threshold input
    box and click "Apply", which sets the threshold to the maximum
    explored distance (the value shown in "Max. explored distance:"
    under the "Search Status" dialog).

Anyway, assuming that you want to use the first of these approaches, you
should use the approach described below. It is difficult to set the
threshold accurately from the image unless you zoom in, so first zoom on
part of the path that you want to set the threshold for.

Since the solid green fill obscures the intensity value of the points in
the fill, I suggest that you switch to the semi-transparent view of the
fill at this stage by selecting the "Transparent overlay" option in the
"Rendering Options" dialog. Note that this may slow down filling.

As you can see in the middle image, the threshold is set too far from
the path, since there are many completely dark points under the green
fill, as well as points on different paths than those of interest.
Experiment with clicking on different points closer to the path in order
to adjust the threshold until you are happy with it. You might end up
with something like the rightmost image:

<div align="center">

  - ![Fill, opaque](Snt-zoomed-filling-2.png "Fill, opaque")
  - ![Fill, with "Transparent overlay" on](Snt-transparent-filling-2.png
    "Fill, with \"Transparent overlay\" on")
  - ![Fill, refined](Snt-refined-filling-2.png "Fill, refined")

</div>

### III.Completing the Fill

If you are happy with this, then you might as well click "Pause" so that
your computer isn't spending all its CPU on continuing to explore the
image. Then you can either:

  - Save the fill (which will add it to the fill list) by clicking
    "Stash Progress".
  - Discard the fill by either clicking "Stop" while filling is in
    progress or, if you stashed the fill, select it in the fill list and
    click "Delete Fill(s)".
  - Use the "Image Stack..." button to view the same image stack, but
    with only the points in that fill preserved. You can choose either a
    grayscale image or a binary mask. One reason why you might want to
    do this is that you can then smooth that image and use the [3D
    Viewer](3D_Viewer "wikilink") to do a surface rendering of the
    neuron. Perhaps then you could overlay that onto a volume rendering
    of the complete image (see available
    [tutorials](Simple_Neurite_Tracer#Tutorials "wikilink")). Or, you
    could save those fill stacks for each of the neurons you fill and
    then combine them in ImageJ using "RGB Merge".

The image stack you would get from the image used in this example might
look something like this: ![Having selected the "Image Stack... -\> As
Grayscale Image..." option](Snt-filling-viewed-2.png
"Having selected the \"Image Stack... -\> As Grayscale Image...\" option")

# Generating *Filtered Images*

This section describes how to generate [Filtered
Images](SNT:_Overview#Tracing_on_Filtered_Image "wikilink") outside SNT.
Note that the filtering used in this walk-through
(*[Frangi](Frangi "wikilink") Vesselness*) is already supported directly
by SNT. This tutorial will assume you need to perform the filtering with
adjusted parameters.

#### A Single Image

To process a single image with the Frangi Vesselness filter, pause SNT,
and select . By way of example, let's say you need to enhance strucutres
at two scales: twice the x voxel separation and five times that value.
We apply a Gaussian convolution at each scale. Assuming your image has
isotropic resolution with pixel width = pixel height = voxel depth = 1,
the parameters would be: ![](frangi-parameters.png)  Save the result
using  ("test-filtered.tif", for example). Then, in SNT's dialog look
for the "Tracing on Secondary Image" widget in the *Main* tab. Click the
file folder button to specify the secondary image. Next, toggle the
"Trace on Secondary Image" checkbox (you can do so using . Now the
pathfinding will occur on the secondary image. To view a MIP of the
secondary image "over" the original image during tracing, toggle the
"Render in overlay at X% opacity" checkbox.

<div align="center">

  - ![Step 1](filtered-image-load.png "Step 1")
  - ![Step 2](filtered-image-toggle.png "Step 2")

</div>

To display the image in a separate window, from the SNT dialog use  from
the *gear* menu or . ![Secondary Image Overlay at 50%
Opacity](display-filtered-image.png
"Secondary Image Overlay at 50% Opacity")

#### Multiple Images

The easiest way to preprocess multiple images is to record a macro for
processing a single image, then wrap it in a loop to iterate over all
files in a directory. For example, using IJ1 macro language:

``` java
d = getDirectory("Select a directory");
files = getFileList(d);
 
extension = ".tif";
 
for( i = 0; i < files.length; ++i ) {
    filename = files[i];
    if( endsWith(filename,extension) ) {
        l = lengthOf(filename);
        el = lengthOf(extension);
        basename = substring(filename,0,l-el);
        expected_window_name = "result";
        output_filename = d + File.separator + basename + ".tubes.tif";
        open(filename);
        run("Frangi Vesselness"); // arguments can be specified here
        selectWindow(expected_window_name);
        saveAs("Tiff", output_filename);
    }
}
```

The same process can be accomplished in a script using [ImageJ
Ops](ImageJ_Ops "wikilink"). For example, in Jython:

``` python
# @ImageJ ij
# @String(value="<HTML>This script applies the Frangi Vesselness filter to all TIFF images in a directory.<br>Only 2D or 3D grayscale images are supported. Processing log is shown in Console.", visibility="MESSAGE") msg
# @File(label="Directory containing your images", style="directory") input_dir
# @String(label="Consider only filenames containing",description="Clear field for no filtering",value="") name_filter
# @boolean(label="Include subdirectories") recursive
# @float(label="Size of structures to be filtered (spatially calibrated units)",description="The filter kernel will be determined from the average voxel size") scale
# @LogService log
# @StatusService status

TBD:

  - Filtered Images
      - Use MIPs for side-by-side original and filtered images
      - FIXME: It is confusing that for single images we use  for
        multiple 
      - Update snapshots of the *Filtered Images* widget
      - Include IJ-ops example
  - Point-accuracy
      - Make new section based on [Simple Neurite Tracer: Accurate point
        placement](Simple_Neurite_Tracer:_Accurate_point_placement "wikilink")

# Accurate Point Placement

This section describes methods to increase the accuracy of node
placement.
