%Replace% LicensesMenu %Replace% The **Apache License** is a
**permissive** [free software](Open_Source "wikilink") license, imposing
minimal restrictions on the redistribution of covered software. This is
in contrast to [copyleft](wikipedia:Copyleft "wikilink") licenses like
the [GPL](GPL "wikilink"), which have reciprocity share-alike
requirements. The Apache License is named for the [Apache Software
Foundation](wikipedia:Apache_Software_Foundation "wikilink"), where it
originated.

See the [Wikipedia article on the Apache
License](wikipedia:Apache_License "wikilink") for more information.

{% capture includecontent %} name = Apache License 2.0 | shortname =
Apache 2 | description = The **Apache 2** license is a permissive
license, similar to the [MIT](MIT "wikilink") and [BSD](BSD "wikilink")
licenses, but with additional protection against patent-related
lawsuits. A licensee of Apache-2-licensed software can:

  - Use, copy and distribute the unmodified source or binary forms of
    the licensed program
  - Use, copy and distribute modified source or binary forms of the
    licensed program, provided that all distributed copies are
    accompanied by the license
