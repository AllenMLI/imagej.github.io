{% include project content='ImageJ1' %} There are a [substantial number
of unit tests](2011-10-07_-_Unit_tests_for_ImageJ_1.45 "wikilink") to
exercise [ImageJ 1.x](ImageJ_1.x "wikilink") functionality. You can find
them in the {% include github content='TODO' %}

  - 

<!-- end list -->

``` bash
git clone git://github.com/imagej/ij1-tests
```

There is a [Travis](Travis "wikilink") job
[here](https://travis-ci.com/imagej/ij1-tests) that automatically runs
the tests with each new version of ImageJ 1.x.

### Running the tests

If you wish to run the unit tests manually, you can do so from the
command line:

``` bash
cd ij1-tests
mvn clean test
```

Or from Eclipse:

1.  Import the `ij1-tests` project using

{% include bc content='File | Import Existing Maven Projects' %}

`and choosing the ij1-tests/pom.xml file.`

1.  Right-click the `ij1-tests` project,

{% include bc content='Run As | JUnit Test' %} .

### Using a different version of ImageJ1

You can change which version of ImageJ1 is tested by overriding the
`imagej1.version` property:

``` bash
mvn -Dimagej1.version=1.48a clean test
```

Or whichever version you wish to use (of [those listed
here](http://maven.imagej.net/content/groups/public/net/imagej/ij/)).
The unit tests were created circa 1.44, and do not compile correctly
with earlier versions of ImageJ.
