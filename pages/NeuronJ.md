[NeuronJ](http://imagescience.org/meijering/software/neuronj/) is an
ImageJ plugin to facilitate the tracing and analysis of elongated image
structures, such as neuronal processes, complementing [Simple Neurite
Tracer](Simple_Neurite_Tracer "wikilink").

NeuronJ features a friendly interface and a detailed [online
manual](https://imagescience.org/meijering/software/neuronj/manual/) but
can only be used to reconstruct 2D images and is not capable of
[SWC](http://www.neuronland.org/NLMorphologyConverter/MorphologyFormats/SWC/Spec.html)
export, the most common format used in neuronal reconstructions. If you
need to reconstruct three-dimensional imagery and require a program
aware of SWC, we recommend using [Simple Neurite
Tracer](Simple_Neurite_Tracer "wikilink") instead.
