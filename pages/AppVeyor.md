{% include develop-menu content='tools'
%}[AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/) is a tool for [continuous
integration](Project_management#Continuous_integration "wikilink") on
[Windows](Windows "wikilink") platforms. It is very useful for
automating builds, deployment and other tasks. {% include toc %}

# Services

Most [ImageJ](ImageJ "wikilink") and [SciJava](SciJava "wikilink")
builds use [Travis CI](Travis_CI "wikilink"). However, for
Windows-specific builds, AppVeyor is used.

See e.g. the [ImageJ
Launcher](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/scijava/imagej-launcher)
build.
