## Upload Sample Image

Use the {% include bc content='Help | Upload Sample Image'%} command to
upload a file (not just images) meant for the ImageJ developers. You
might need to do this e.g. when the file is too large for email
attachments, or when you want to accompany a [bug
report](Report_a_Bug "wikilink") with a large image.

To prevent abuse of this facility, access to the uploaded images is
restricted to trusted admins of [this
Wiki](Special:Incoming "wikilink").

If you upload a sample image and would like it to be deleted, just let
us know [on the forum](http://forum.imagej.net/) with a post or private
message to an admin.
