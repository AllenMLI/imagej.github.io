(Return to the main [3D Viewer](3D_Viewer "wikilink") page)

The 3D viewer is more than a 3D visualization application. It was
designed to serve as a high-level programming library for 3D
visualization, especially for the visualization of 3D biomedical images.

The document in hand is intended to provide a set of examples and
use-cases. The HowTo's are ordered with increasing complexity. Each
HowTo itself starts by explaining a basic example, referring to example
code. The example code can be downloaded from the [Examples'
site](3D_Viewer:_Example_code "wikilink"). Each HowTo then continues to
describe more detailed aspects, as well as other background information.

The fastest way to get started is to look at the examples, which should
be pretty much self-explaining. For the features of interest, it is
recommended to read the corresponding HowTo.

### How To...

... [create a universe and display an image stack as volume rendering,
orthoslices, iso-surface or surface
plot](3D_Viewer:_Display_a_Stack "wikilink")

... [change color, transparency etc of a 3D object
(=Content)](3D_Viewer:_Change_Attributes "wikilink")

... [apply a specific transformation to a
Content](3D_Viewer:_Apply_Transformation "wikilink")

... [highlight specific points of a
Content](3D_Viewer:_Highlight_Points "wikilink")

... [create movie recordings](3D_Viewer:_Record_a_Movie "wikilink")

... [understand the relation between Content and
Universe](3D_Viewer:_Content_Structure "wikilink")

... [to work with volume
renderings](3D_Viewer:_Volume_Rendering "wikilink")

... [to work with orthoslices](3D_Viewer:_Orthoslices "wikilink")

... [to work with surface plots](3D_Viewer:_Surface_Plot "wikilink")

... [to work with isosurfaces](3D_Viewer:_Isosurface "wikilink")

... [add custom surfaces to a
universe](3D_Viewer:_Custom_Surface "wikilink")

... [display 4D data](3D_Viewer:_4D_Viewer "wikilink")

... [display two canvasses showing the same
universe](3D_Viewer:_Two_Canvasses "wikilink")

... [catch and handle mouse and key
events](3D_Viewer:_CustomBehavior "wikilink")
