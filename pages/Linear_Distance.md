Plugin for ImageJ to measure linear distances in images in X and Y
direction. At this time, two methods are implemented: First, the
automatic scan of a binarized, two phased image. Second, the interactive
placement of marks which will be measured afterwards (Linear
Interception).

More information on github.

For automatic installation in Fiji, add update site SimonKlein.
