{% include Infobox content="name = BoneJ 1.x | software = ImageJ | logo
= ![Bonej-icon.png](Bonej-icon.png "Bonej-icon.png") | author = BoneJ is
a plugin for bone image analysis in [ImageJ](ImageJ "wikilink"). It
provides free, open source tools for trabecular geometry and whole bone
shape analysis.

## Experimental release ([BoneJ2](BoneJ2 "wikilink"))

There's a new modernized version of BoneJ available through the ImageJ
[updater](https://imagej.net/Updater). Read more about
[BoneJ2](BoneJ2 "wikilink").

## Installation

{% include Logo content="ImageJ1 | size=24px" %} BoneJ was designed to
work with plain [ImageJ 1.x](ImageJ_1.x "wikilink").

{% include Logo content="Fiji | size=24px" %} BoneJ can be installed
into [Fiji](Fiji "wikilink"), but you must **use the Java-6 version of
Fiji, not the current Java-8 version**:

  - Download the final Java-6 version of Fiji labeled “2017 May 30” from
    [here](Fiji/Downloads#Java_6 "wikilink").
  - Unpack it somewhere beneath your home folder.
  - Download and install `BoneJ_.jar` into that installation's `plugins`
    folder.
  - Launch Fiji and run {% include bc content="Plugins | 3D Viewer" %}
    to trigger installation of the [3D Viewer](3D_Viewer "wikilink").
  - Restart Fiji.

For technical details about ImageJ and Fiji using Java 6 vs. Java 8, see
the [Java 8](Java_8 "wikilink") page.

## BoneJ and pQCT

BoneJ and pQCT plug-ins are in the process of separation. The latter
have their own \[<https://imagej.net/PQCT>| update site\], and they
don't need BoneJ to work. However, if you download `BoneJ_.jar` from
<http://bonej.org/> it still includes older versions of the pQCT tools.
