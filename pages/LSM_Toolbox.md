The LSM Toolbox provides plugins for working with Carl Zeiss LSM510 .lsm
files.

## Usage

The LSM Toolbox project aims at the integration of common useful
functions around the Zeiss lsm file format, that should enhance
usability of confocal lsm files kept in their native format, thus
preserving all available metadata.

In Fiji, corresponding commands are:

  - which displays the toolbox, from which all commands can be called;

  - which displays information about the plugin.

For more info see [LSM ToolBox documentation on ImageJ documentation
