%}The **GNU Lesser General Public License** is a free, [open
source](open_source "wikilink") license for software and other kinds of
works. It is a middle ground between
**[copyleft](wikipedia:Copyleft "wikilink")** licenses such as the
[GPL](GPL "wikilink") and **permissive** licenses like
[BSD](BSD "wikilink") and [MIT](MIT "wikilink"). The LGPL requires
modifications to the work to also be distributed under OSS terms, but
allows the work to be included (unmodified) in non-OSS combined works
without propagating its terms onto the combined work itself.

As such, the LGPL is considered a more "commercial friendly" license
than the GPL, since LGPL libraries can be freely utilized by commercial
software.

See the [Wikipedia article on the
LGPL](wikipedia:GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License "wikilink") for more
information.
