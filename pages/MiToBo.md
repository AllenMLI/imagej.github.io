The Microscope Image Analysis Toolbox MiToBo is a collection of basic
and advanced image processing operators and applications mainly
dedicated to biological and biomedical image data, however, not
restricted to these fields. MiToBo is an extension of
[ImageJ](ImageJ "wikilink"), i.e. MiToBo operators are ready to be
directly used as plugins in ImageJ.

To make use of MiToBo's functionality it can be enabled by [toggling the
MiToBo update site](Update_Sites "wikilink").

For further details, see the [MiToBo
website](http://www.informatik.uni-halle.de/mitobo/).

MiToBo is based on the [Alida](Alida "wikilink") framework. MiToBo's
operators are managed by Alida's graphical operator runner. In addition,
and thanks to Alida's built-in graphical workflow editor *Grappa* also
image analysis workflows can easily be designed graphically.
