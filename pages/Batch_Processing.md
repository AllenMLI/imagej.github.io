# Overview

A fundamental benefit to creating [scripts and
macros](Scripting "wikilink") in [ImageJ](ImageJ "wikilink") is the
ability to *reuse* their functionality *on more than one image*.
Although this can be done manually, there are multiple ways to easily
automate this batch processing.

# General workflow

1.  Create a basic macro/script which operates on the active image or on
    a single file.
      - The [macro
        recorder](Introduction_into_Macro_Programming#The_recorder "wikilink")
        is an excellent way to generate macro code.
      - The [Introduction into Macro
        Programming](Introduction_into_Macro_Programming "wikilink")
        explains the principles of macro writing.
2.  Apply your macro to a group of images.
      - These images do not need to be open in ImageJ already—they will
        be read in as part of the batch process.
      - See below for details.

# Option 1 - 

The fastest way to start batch conversion is via the
[](https://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-29.html#toc-Subsubsection-29.12.3)
command. This will open a dialog (below) that will allow you to specify
an input and output directory. You can select an output file format, and
then use the `Add Macro Code` drop-down to generate a macro with the
desired functionality.

# Option 2 - Script Template

Open the [script editor](Using_the_Script_Editor "wikilink"), select .
This will generate the following boilerplate:

![Process\_folder\_ij1.png](Process_folder_ij1.png
"Process_folder_ij1.png")

Lines 26 and 27 can now be edited, replaced with the functional macro
code you would like to apply to all images of a given type in a folder.
Furthermore you can now modify the batch processing logic itself, for
example if you need to customize what (if any) output information is
saved.

# Option 3 - Batch Processing with Script Parameters
