If you want to fuse or deconvolve a sub-volume of your dataset (other
than *all views* or the *currently selected views*), you have to specify
that volume by defining a **Bounding Box**.

The Bounding Box Definition can be started by clicking **Define Bounding
Box...** in the main menu, located under `Fusion` (Stitching mode) or
`Displaying` (MultiView mode).

## Bounding Box Definition

In the first dialog, you can specify how to define you bounding box in
the **Bounding Box** drop-down menu. The available options are explained
in detail below. In addition, you can give your Bounding box a name
under **Bounding Box Name**.

The dialog will also list the currently **Existing Bounding Boxes**

### Modify pre-defined Bounding Box

First, you will be asked for the existing bounding box that you want to
modify:

In the next dialog, you can modify the bounding box by adjusting the
sliders for the minima and maxima. The size and memory/disk space
requirements of a fusion will also be previewed. Clicking **OK** will
generate the new, modified Mounding Box.

### Define using the BigDataViewer interactively

This will open a new window allowing you to modify your bounding box by
adjusting the sliders for the minima and maxima. If the BigDataViewer is
open, the bounding box will be previewed there.

After clicking **OK**, another dialog will show a preview of the
bounding box size and expected memory/disk space requirements for a
fused image of the contents of the bounding box. Click **OK** again to
complete the definition.

### Maximal Bounding Box spanning all transformed views

This will simply show the **Manually define Bounding Box**-dialog,
preset to a bounding box enclosing all selected views. You can use the
sliders to modify the minima and maxima of the bounding box. Click
**OK** to finish the definition.

### Automatically find Bounding Box through image filtering

This method will try to automatically find a bounding box around the
sample by applying a **minimum filter** and then **thresholding** a
downsampled version of the fused image.

{% include sidebox-right content='This method will try to segment a
bright object in front of dark background, so it cannot be used e.g. for
brightfield images with dark objects in front a bright background.' %}

You will be asked for the following parameters:

  - **Background intensity (%)**: relative intensity of background to
    the maximal intensity in the images, used for thresholding.
  - **Size of objects to be discarded**: size of the box-minimum-filter
    that is applied to the image before thresholding, effectively
    removing isolated objects smaller than that.
  - **Downsampling**: by how much to downsample the fused image. Since
    fusion can be a time and memory-consuming process, we recommend to
    use a large (\(>4\)) downsampling factor, especially if your dataset
    is big.
  - *' Display image used for segmentation*': selecting this will show
    the fused and the filtered images.

After clicking **OK**, the bounding box will be estimated and another
dialog will show a preview of the bounding box size and expected
memory/disk space requirements for a fused image of the contents of the
bounding box. Click **OK** again to complete the definition.
