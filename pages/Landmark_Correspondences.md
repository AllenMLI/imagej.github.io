The plugin **Landmark Correspondences** calculates a transformation
between two corresponding landmark clouds and renders a transformed
image. The landmarks are read from point selections over two images. The
transformation is estimated by a least squares or Moving Least Squares
fit for the available models.

The non-linear non-invertible transformations as estimated using the
Moving Least Squares method are rendered through a mesh of triangles
whose resolution is a parameter of the plugin, see [Interactive Moving
Least Squares](Interactive_Moving_Least_Squares "wikilink") for an
intuitive explanation. {{-}} ![Two snapshots from the ImageJ Conference
