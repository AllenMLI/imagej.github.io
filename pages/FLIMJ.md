## Introduction

The FLIMJ plugin for ImageJ provides the ability to analyze FLIM data
within ImageJ, using the [FLIMLib](https://flimlib.github.io/) library.
The plugin can be installed into the [Fiji](Fiji "wikilink")
distribution of ImageJ simply by enabling the FLIMJ [update
site](update_site "wikilink"). Features include:

  - Fit individual pixels, entire images per-pixel, or do global
    analysis on entire images, using FLIMLib's rapid lifetime
    determination (RLD), Levenberg-Marquardt (LMA) or global analysis
    (Global) fitting algorithms
  - Single, double and triple exponential fits
  - Gaussian, Poisson and Maximum Likelihood Estimation noise models
  - Produce one or several fitted images depending which parameters (A,
    τ, Z, χ²) are chosen for visualization
  - Full control over the start and end fit cutoffs known as "cursors"
  - Binning options for various kernel sizes to reduce noise and boost
    intensity when fitting per-pixel
  - Support for so-called "excitation" or "prompt" files containing a
    recorded system response function to be convolved with the
    exponential fit
  - Batch processing support for analyzing many lifetime images as part
    of a [scripting](scripting "wikilink") workflow

## Installation

The FLIMJ plugin is available from the "FLIMJ" [update
site](update_site "wikilink").

Once you have installed the FLIMJ plugin, it becomes available on the
menu under {% include bc content='Analyze | Lifetime | FLIMJ' %} .
