{% include component-stats content=':sc.fiji:Sync\_Win' %}The Sync
Windows plugin synchronizes mouse motion and input between multiple
windows. Thus, an ROI drawn in one window is replicated in all other
synchronized windows in the synchronized window set. A synchronization
cursor (the red box above) indicates the location of the mouse in all
synchronized windows.

## Installation

**ImageJ**: Copy the Sync\_Win.jar file from
https://imagej.net/plugins/download/jars/Sync_Win.jar into the
ImageJ/Plugins folder and either restart ImageJ or run the {% include bc
content='Help | Update Menus'%} command. After this two new commands
should appear in {% include bc content='Analyze | Tools'%}: **Sync
Windows** and **Sync Measure 3D**.

**Fiji**: this plugin is part of the Fiji distribution, there is no need
to download it.

## Use

The command {% include bc content='Analyze | Tools | Sync Windows'%}
opens a dialog that allows to choose what features should be
synchronized:

  - Sync Cursor
  - Sync Channels
  - Image Coordinates
  - Sync z-Slices
  - Sync t-Frames
  - Image Scaling

Clicking on **Synchronize All** starts synchronizing all windows,
clicking on **Unsynchronize All** stops synchronization.
