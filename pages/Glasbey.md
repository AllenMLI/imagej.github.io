%}![Glasbey.png](Glasbey.png "Glasbey.png")The Glasbey lookup table
(LUT) is a color table structured in a maximally discontinuous manner.
That is, adjacent color bins are chosen to be as distinct from one
another as possible.

Like other LUTs, it is available from the {% include bc content="Image |
Lookup Tables" %} menu.

The LUT called "glasbey" uses white at the first index, whereas "glasbey
inverted" starts with black.

## Labelings

The Glasbey LUT has numerous uses. It is ideal when coloring a
"labeling" of integer-coded regions, since each region will then appear
obviously distinct:

## JPEG artifacts

Glasbey can also be used to illustrate otherwise-subtle phenomena such
as JPEG compression artifacts. Here is a comparison of the Boats sample
image before and after being resaved as a JPEG:

![The grayscale LUT makes it very difficult (for most people) to see any
visual difference.](JPEG-grayscale.png
"The grayscale LUT makes it very difficult (for most people) to see any visual difference.")
![The Glasbey LUT makes it quite obvious where JPEG compression caused a
loss of data fidelity.](JPEG-glasbey.png
"The Glasbey LUT makes it quite obvious where JPEG compression caused a loss of data fidelity.")

## Publication

The Glasbey LUT is based on the publication:
