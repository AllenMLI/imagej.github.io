{% include menu-cookbook%}
This book is an analysis-oriented introduction and user guide to ImageJ. It is inspired by the defunct [MBF "ImageJ for microscopy" manual](MBF_Plugin_Collection "wikilink") which went offline in November 2012, and it describes many of the same plugins from that distribution.

Cooks call them *recipes*, biologists *protocols*, and programmers call them *HOWTOs*. No matter how you refer to them, you'll find the book topics in the sidebar to the right\!

Like the rest of this wiki, this Cookbook is a community project. Please feel welcome to edit and expand the material here\! {% include toc%}


## Installing ImageJ

The Cookbook is based on the [Fiji](Fiji "wikilink") distribution of ImageJ. {% include downloadfiji%}
