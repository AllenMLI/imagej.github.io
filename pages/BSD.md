\_\_NOTOC\_\_ **BSD licenses** are a family of **permissive** [free
software](Open_Source "wikilink") licenses, imposing minimal
restrictions on the redistribution of covered software. This is in
contrast to [copyleft](wikipedia:Copyleft "wikilink") licenses like the
[GPL](GPL "wikilink"), which have reciprocity share-alike requirements.
The original BSD license was used for its namesake, the Berkeley
Software Distribution (BSD), a Unix-like operating system. The original
version has since been revised and its descendants are more properly
termed modified BSD licenses.

See the [Wikipedia article on BSD
licenses](wikipedia:BSD_licenses "wikilink") for more information.
