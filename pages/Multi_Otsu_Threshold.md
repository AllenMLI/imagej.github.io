## Purpose

This plugin segments the image in classes by thresholding. It uses the
same algorithm found in [Otsu
Thresholding](Otsu_Thresholding "wikilink"), but was adapted to output
more than 2 classes out of the process.

## Documentation

This plugin implements an algorithm described in the following paper

A thresholding algorithm will typically classify pixels in two classes
(or two set of objects): the one that have their intensity lower than a
certain threshold (generally, the background), and the other (the
interesting features). This plugin is based on the [Otsu
Thresholding](Otsu_Thresholding "wikilink") technique, adapted to
generate *multiple* thresholds and *multiple* classes from one single
image.

For example, by setting the desired number of classes to 3 (the
algorithm then needs to find 2 thresholds), one can get background
pixels, bright pixels and intermediate pixels. This might be of interest
for images where there is such a pixel populations. In the example
depicted below, based on the blob image, one could get the background,
the blobs center and the blob edges out of it.

Image:Blobs.png|Original image: blobs on a dark background
Image:Blobs\_MultiOtsu\_1.png|First class: the dark pixels as background
Image:Blobs\_MultiOtsu\_2.png|Second class: the intermediate pixels
delineate the edges Image:Blobs\_MultiOtsu\_3.png|Third class: the
bright pixels form the blobs centers
