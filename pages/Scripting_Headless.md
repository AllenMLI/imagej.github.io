{% include learn content='scripting' %} [ImageJ
scripts](Scripting "wikilink") are designed to operate independently of
user interface—including [headless](headless "wikilink"), with **no**
user interface. This is made easy with the use of [script
parameters](Script_parameters "wikilink").

To start ImageJ in the ImageJ2 headless mode, run (with the launcher
appropriate for your system substituted):

    ./ImageJ-linux64 --ij2 --headless

By default, when ImageJ runs headlessly it acts like a one-off program:
it will only perform the requested operations, then quit. To run a
script headlessly, use:

    ./ImageJ-linux64 --ij2 --headless --run path/to/script [key1=value1,key2=value2,...]

{% capture includecontent %} In many cases, it is necessary to enclose
the entire list of key/value pairs in single quotes, to avoid shell
expansion. See the following examples. {% endcapture %}

{% include warning-box content=includecontent %}

## Basic run

Let's say we have the following Python script saved in a file,
`hello.py`:

``` python
#@String name

print('Hello ' + name)
```

we could run this script with the command:

    ./ImageJ-linux64 --ij2 --headless --console --run hello.py 'name="Mr Kraken"'

Note that the `name` parameter must be enclosed in double quotes, since
it is a string literal.

The optional `--console` argument allows to have `print`, `IJ.log` and
error statements returned to the console window.

On Windows systems, single/double quotes might be inverted though, such
that strings are enclosed in single quotes while the list of argument as
well as the path to the py script are in double quotes.

    ImageJ-win64.exe --ij2 --headless --console --run "PathTo/hello.py" "name='Mr Kraken'"

## Multiple parameters

If your script has more than one parameter:

``` python
#@String name1
#@String name2

print('Hello ' + name1 + " and " + name2)
```

then these are filled by using a comma-separated list of parameter
pairs—e.g.:

    ./ImageJ-linux64 --ij2 --headless --console --run hello.py 'name1="Mr",name2="Mrs Kraken"'

Similarly for Windows (again respect single/double quotes),

    ImageJ-win64.exe --ij2 --headless --console --run "PathTo/hello.py" "name1='Mr', name2='Kraken'"
