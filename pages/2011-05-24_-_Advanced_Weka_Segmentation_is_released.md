We have implemented and released a new and advanced
machine-learning-based segmentation plugin: [Advanced Weka
Segmentation](Advanced_Weka_Segmentation "wikilink"). The core of the
plugin is the [Trainable
Segmentation](Trainable_Segmentation "wikilink") plugin but it includes
now many more capabilities and features. The user can choose between any
classifier available in the latest version of
[Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/), load/save all data and
classifiers, select and tune many more features, get a probability map
rather than a binary image, interact directly with the
[Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) GUI, record the plugin
actions in the macro recorder, call the plugin methods from another
plugin or script...

The plugin is still experimental, but please, go ahead and use it. Any
feedback is welcome\!
