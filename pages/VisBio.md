VisBio is a biological visualization tool designed for easy
visualization and analysis of multidimensional image data, developed by 
at [UW-Madison LOCI](http://loci.wisc.edu/).

VisBio is based on the [VisAD](http://visad.ssec.wisc.edu/) Java
component library for interactive and collaborative visualization and
analysis of numerical data. VisBio was first released in 2002. It was
discontinued in 2009 in favor of [ImageJ2](ImageJ2 "wikilink"), with the
idea that the VisAD-based visualization components of VisBio could be
migrated to the ImageJ platform in the future.
