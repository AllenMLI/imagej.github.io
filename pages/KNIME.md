[KNIME](http://knime.org/), the **K**o**n**stanz **I**nformation
**M**in**e**r, is an open source data analytics, reporting and
integration platform. KNIME integrates various components for machine
learning and data mining through its modular data pipelining concept. A
graphical user interface allows assembly of nodes for data preprocessing
(ETL: Extraction, Transformation, Loading), for modeling and data
analysis and visualization.

The [**KN**IME **I**mage
**P**rocessing](http://tech.knime.org/community/image-processing)
extension, KNIP, provides ca. 100 nodes for (pre)-processing, filtering,
segmentation, feature extraction, various views (2D, 3D), etc. and
integrations for various other image processing tools are available.

As part of the KNIP extension, there is an [ImageJ extension for
KNIME](http://tech.knime.org/community/imagej) consisting of two basic
parts: the support for [ImageJ1](ImageJ1 "wikilink") macro execution and
the integration of [ImageJ2](ImageJ2 "wikilink") plugins as KNIME nodes.
Both approaches are available as KNIME plugin (currently beta status).

    image-processing algorithms, which is developed as a collaboration
    between the [ImageJ](ImageJ "wikilink") and KNIME teams.
