%}The **MIT License** is a **permissive** [free
software](Open_Source "wikilink") license, imposing minimal restrictions
on the redistribution of covered software. This is in contrast to
[copyleft](wikipedia:Copyleft "wikilink") licenses like the
[GPL](GPL "wikilink"), which have reciprocity share-alike requirements.
The MIT license is named for the [Massachusetts Institute of
Technology](http://mit.edu/), where it originated.

See the [Wikipedia article on the MIT
license](wikipedia:MIT_License "wikilink") for more information.

{% include license name='MIT License' shortname='MIT' description='The
"""MIT""" license is a simple permissive license, functionally
equivalent to the [Simplified BSD License](BSD-2 "wikilink"). A licensee
of MIT-licensed software can:

  - Use, copy and distribute the unmodified source or binary forms of
    the licensed program
  - Use, copy and distribute modified source or binary forms of the
    licensed program, provided that all distributed copies are
    accompanied by the license'
