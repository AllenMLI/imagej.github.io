## Purpose

![The ROI Picker tool selected.](ROI_Picker.png
"The ROI Picker tool selected.")

This tool allows clicking to select existing ROIs. Clicking within the
bounds of a ROI will select it in the ROI Manager. If multiple ROIs
overlap over the clicked area, the union of the ROIs will be selected.
Repeated clicks with the tool will then cycle through all individual
ROIs in the union.
