After making this choice of segmentation in the advanced mode the
following panel appears

![TrackAdvancedWater.png](/images/pages/TrackAdvancedWater.png
"TrackAdvancedWater.png")"

Here the user can again make a choice of increasing or decreasing the
edge enhancement factor.

All the watershed and MSER parameters appear in the second panel. The
threshold value to create the binary image to perform watershedding has
been explained in the section about it in [watershedding and Hough
transform
parameters](watershedding_and_Hough_transform_parameters "wikilink").

Apart from having the options of displaying Bitimage and Watershedimage
the user can also ask the program to auto determine the threshold value
in which case Otsu method of determination of an appropriate threshold
value would be used, else the user can deselect this option and make
their own selection of the threshold value.

The MSER parameters that appear here as explained in [MSER
parameters](MSER_parameters "wikilink")

After making suitable parameter selection the user can then go over the
tracking options where they can see some advanced parameter selections
for the optimizer and assignment layer of the program. This panel is
shown here

![ModelChoice.png](/images/pages/ModelChoice.png "ModelChoice.png")"

selection](sub-pixel_localization_parameter_selection "wikilink").

  - Start tracking

If the user does not wish to change the default settings for sub-pixel
localization, they can skip this step and directly click on start
tracking button to start the tracking from user defined first and last
frame.

  - Save parameters

After successful tracking, the user has the option to save the program
parameters, so that the movie can be run (again) in batch mode. This
choice can also be made without doing the tracking after just making the
parameter selection. Clicking on this button triggers the close of the
program and saves the program parameters in IJ.log file of FIJI, this
close of program is done to ensure that the log file is properly updated
by FIJI.
