{% include info-box content=includecontent %} The
[ImageJFX](http://www.imagejfx.net/) project aims to create a new user
interface for [ImageJ](ImageJ "wikilink") in order to ease scientific
image analysis. While keeping the core components of ImageJ, ImageJFX
brings scientists closer to their goal by making the interface clearer
for beginners and more practical for advanced users.
