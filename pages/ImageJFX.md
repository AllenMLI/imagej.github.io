The [ImageJFX](http://www.imagejfx.net/) project aims to create a new
user interface for [ImageJ](ImageJ "wikilink") in order to ease
scientific image analysis. While keeping the core components of ImageJ,
ImageJFX brings scientists closer to their goal by making the interface
clearer for beginners and more practical for advanced users.
