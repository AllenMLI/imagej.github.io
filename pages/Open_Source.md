" 64px | left | link=https://opensource.org/")" The
[ImageJ](ImageJ "wikilink") project, and related projects in the
[SciJava](SciJava "wikilink") software ecosystem, are open source
software projects. See the [Licensing](Licensing "wikilink") page for
details.

Everybody is welcome to [contribute](contribute "wikilink") with
[plugins](plugins "wikilink"), patches, [bug reports](Bugs "wikilink"),
[tutorials](tutorials "wikilink"),
[documentation](documentation "wikilink"), and artwork.

The [SciJava](SciJava "wikilink") ecosystem is strongly committed to
open-source software development. This software is not an open source
software *product*â€”it is an open-source software *project* following an
open-source development *process*. There are public [source code
repositories](Source_Code "wikilink"), public
[communication](communication "wikilink") channels, public [project
management](project_management "wikilink") resources, and of course,
this [community editable website](Help:Contents "wikilink"). See the
[Philosophy](Philosophy "wikilink") page for more information.

## Why open source?

One core principle of the [scientific
method](wikipedia:Scientific_method "wikilink") is repeatability: the
ability to continually retest and refine hypotheses. As computer
software plays an increasingly large role in science, it is vital that
that software be fully transparent and available to researchers:
software is simply too complex to be easily
[reproduced](Reproducibility "wikilink") from scratch by every research
group. In contrast, closed source software presents a barrier to [open
research](wikipedia:Open_research_computation#Reproducibility_and_open_research_computing "wikilink"),
because the implementation details of algorithms cannot be freely
modified or even necessarily verified.

The [Science Code Manifesto](http://sciencecodemanifesto.org/discussion)
provides a clear and succinct list of five principles surrounding
scientific software. There have also been a number of publications in
recent years discussing these issues and ideas:

  - [Ten Simple Rules for the Open Development of Scientific
    Software](http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002802)
    (PLOS Computational Biology, Dec 2012)
  - [A call for bioimaging software
    usability](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v9/n7/full/nmeth.2073.html)
    (Nature Methods, Jun 2012)
  - [Current challenges in open-source bioimage
    informatics](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v9/n7/full/nmeth.2082.html)
    (Nature Methods, Jun 2012)
  - [Publish your computer code: it is good
    enough](http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101013/full/467753a.html)
    (Nature, Oct 2010)
  - [Metadata matters: access to image data in the real
    world](http://jcb.rupress.org/content/189/5/777.full) (Journal of
    Cell Biology, May 2010)

Further, we strive for ImageJ to be a community driven project. It is
not merely an [open source](wikipedia:Open_source "wikilink") *product*,
but an open source *process*. ImageJ follows open development practices,
and provides open development tools online:

  - Public [source code](source_code "wikilink") repositories including
    complete development history.
  - Public [issue trackers](Issues "wikilink").
  - Public [communication channels](Communication "wikilink") for open
    discussion.
  - Public [wiki](https://imagej.net/) for community contributed
    content.
  - [Travis CI](Travis_CI "wikilink"), ImageJ's public [continuous
    integration](wikipedia:Continuous_integration "wikilink") system.
  - Public [Maven repository](SciJava_Maven_repository "wikilink") for
    ImageJ binaries.

Using these resources, you can always observe the latest progress of the
project, get an idea of where the project is heading, contribute code to
the project yourself using GitHub, or write documentation, tutorials and
other information on the wiki.
