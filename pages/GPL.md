\_\_NOTOC\_\_ The **GNU General Public License** is a free,
**[copyleft](wikipedia:Copyleft "wikilink")** [open
source](open_source "wikilink") license for software and other kinds of
works. This is in contrast to **permissive** licenses like
[BSD](BSD "wikilink"), which impose minimal restrictions on the
redistribution of covered software. The GPL ensures that granted
freedoms are preserved whenever the work is distributed, even when the
work is changed or added to.

See the [Wikipedia article on the
GPL](wikipedia:GNU_General_Public_License "wikilink") for more
information.
