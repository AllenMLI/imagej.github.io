The **GNU General Public License** is a free, **[copyleft](wikipedia_Copyleft "wikilink")** [open source](open_source "wikilink") license for software and other kinds of works. This is in contrast to **permissive** licenses like [BSD](BSD "wikilink"), which impose minimal restrictions on the redistribution of covered software. The GPL ensures that granted freedoms are preserved whenever the work is distributed, even when the work is changed or added to.

See the [Wikipedia article on the GPL](wikipedia_GNU_General_Public_License "wikilink") for more information.
