[OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) is a widespread computer vision and machine
learning library applied in a great variety of contexts, including life
sciences. The power of OpenCV relies on the huge amount (more than 2500)
of both classic and state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms provided
by this library. OpenCV supplies algorithms for: image processing,
feature detection, object detection, machine-learning, and video
analysis.

Currently, there are three alternatives to connect ImageJ with OpenCV:

  - [CVForge](https://github.com/m4dguy/CVForge): an ImageJ plugin
    implementing a simple-to-use interface that gives access to all the
    methods of OpenCV.
  - [IJ-OpenCV](IJ-OpenCV "wikilink"): a library to create applications
    combining features from both ImageJ and OpenCV. From the perspective
    of ImageJ developers, they can use IJ-OpenCV to easily create
    plugins that use any functionality provided by the OpenCV library
    and explore different alternatives. From the perspective of OpenCV
    developers, this library provides a link to the ImageJ graphical
    user interface and all its features to handle regions of interest.
  - [IJToolsUsingOpenCV](https://github.com/WAKU-TAKE-A/IJToolsUsingOpenCV):
    a suite of ImageJ plugins that connects ImageJ with some of the
    algorithms implemented in OpenCV.
