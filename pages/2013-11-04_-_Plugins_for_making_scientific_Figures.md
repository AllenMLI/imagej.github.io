Writing papers and making figures is and always will be a big part of
what scientists do. Many of us use open source software, such as Fiji,
to process images however the figure is often finalised in commercial
software - typically from Adobe. Needless to say neither Photoshop nor
Illustrator are designed to make scientific figures.

Two groups have recently introduced plugins that leverage the tools
available in ImageJ/Fiji to make scientific figures. Both tools are made
by scientists introducing innovative concepts specifically designed to
make scientific figure making easier and more controlled.

[**FigureJ**](http://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/doku.php?id=plugin:utilities:figurej:start)
from *Jerome Mutterer* and
[**ScientiFig**](http://srv-gred.u-clermont1.fr/labmirouse/software/)
from *Benoit Aigouy* are well documented, open source ({% include github
org='mutterer' repo='figurej' label='FigureJ' %} {% include github
org='baigouy' repo='ScientiFig' label='ScientiFig' %}) and published:

Mutterer, J. & Zinck, E. (2013) **Quick-and-clean article figures with
FigureJ** *Journal of Microscopy*, 252 (1), 1365-2818
<doi:10.1111/jmi.12069>

Aigouy B. & Mirouse V. (2013) **ScientiFig: a tool to build
publication-ready scientific figures** *Nature Methods*, 10, 1048
<doi:10.1038/nmeth.2692>

Each tool is available in Fiji through its own {% include

Finally the OMERO team is also rolling out a Figure making plugin
showcased here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anJPPx7uoUM.

Making figures will never be the same.
