**JavaFX** is the new graphical toolkit that will on the long term probably **replace Swing**. This page aims to give some guidelines to be able to build ImageJ2 plugin with JavaFX.

*Please don't hesitate to edit this page and add your tricks and/or experience about JavaFX and ImageJ2.*

## Some things to know

  - JavaFX is only available since **Java 8**.
  - JavaFX is **not shipped** with OpenJDK but it is with the **Oracle JDK**.
  - JavaFX development seems to move to the OpenJFX project : http://openjdk.java.net/projects/openjfx. But it's unclear what is going on for now...
  - **SceneBuilder** is a graphical interface that help creating JavaFX FXML files. Oracle stopped distributing SceneBuilder binaries (I don't know why). You can find new binaries from the **Gluon project** there : http://gluonhq.com/open-source/scene-builder

## Under the hood

Usually a JavaFX program needs to declare a `javafx.application.Application`. Because only **one** `Application` instance can exist at runtime, I think under IJ1/IJ2 interface (using Swing), if you want to use JavaFX you need to use the `javafx.embed.swing.JFXPanel` class which make the link/bridge between a `JFrame` and JavaFX.

  - An example of the usual `javafx.application.Application` can be found here : https://github.com/hadim/imagej-plugin-javafx/blob/master/src/main/java/net/imagej/plugin/minimalJavaFXPlugin/gui/MainApp.java

<!-- end list -->

  - An example of how to use `javafx.embed.swing.JFXPanel` can be found here : https://github.com/hadim/imagej-plugin-javafx/blob/master/src/main/java/net/imagej/plugin/minimalJavaFXPlugin/gui/MainAppFrame.java

## A minimal ImageJ 2 JavaFX plugin

I have created a **minimal ImageJ plugin** that show how to use JavaFX for the UI of a plugin there : https://github.com/hadim/imagej-plugin-javafx (this plugin should maybe moved to the imagej GitHub organization so any IJ devs can more easly edit).
