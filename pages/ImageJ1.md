{% include project content='ImageJ1' %} ImageJ 1.x, often shortened to
ImageJ1 or IJ1, is a stable version of [ImageJ](ImageJ "wikilink") which
has been under continuous development since 1997. It has always been,
and continues to be, a one-developer project of {% include person
content='Rasband' %} .

ImageJ was originally developed in 1997 as a cross-platform version of
[NIH Image](NIH_Image "wikilink"). ImageJ grew organically over time as
{% include person content='Rasband' %}

`continued to add features according to user requests. Now there are many hundreds, probably thousands, of plugins written by members of a diverse community.`

The current version of ImageJ is often referred to as
[ImageJ2](ImageJ2 "wikilink"), to differentiate it from ImageJ 1.x. The
ImageJ2 distribution actually includes the latest version of ImageJ1 as
well, along with a [legacy layer](ImageJ_Legacy "wikilink") for
backwards compatibility, which transparently converts between IJ1 and
IJ2 data structures as needed.
