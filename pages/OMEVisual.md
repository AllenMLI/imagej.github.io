## Presentation

`OMEVisual` is a Fiji plugin to easily visualize OME metadata.

Usage:

  - Open your image in Fiji.
  - Start the plugin with `Plugins ► Utilities ► Visualize OME
    Metadata`.
  - A window should open with the metadata in it.

Please note that :

  - This goal of this plugin is **not to implement** all the OME
    features.
  - This plugin makes several strong assumptions about the OME model in
    order to simplify the interface :
      - Each image contains only one `Pixels` element.
      - Each `TiffData` contains only one `Plane`.
      - `Plane` and `TiffData` informations are displayed at the same
        location without distinction.
  - Any ideas to improve the visualization and/or add OME features is
    very welcome :
      - The best way is to submit a PR.
      - You can also open an issue and post an OME-TIFF file which
        contains additional OME features you would like to see added to
        the plugin.
