From Wednesday, September 20, 2017 through Friday, September 28, 2017,
{% include Person content="Dietzc" %} of [KNIME](https://www.knime.org)
hosted \~20 developers at the [KNIME Konstanz Regional
Office](https://www.knime.com/contact) for a
[hackathon](hackathon "wikilink") to develop the KNIME Image Processing
extensions along with the underlying [ImageJ Ops](ImageJ_Ops "wikilink")
library, as well as other related and/or supporting technologies such as
[Ilastik](http://ilastik.org/), [ImgLib2](ImgLib2 "wikilink") and
[BigDataViewer](BigDataViewer "wikilink").

There was a big focus this time on machine learning, particularly deep
learning networks applied to biological data.

    repository.

### Florian Jug

  - Worked on a KNIME workflow that starts IsoNet-type deep nets on a

## Technical discussions

  - Fiji component and application releases: today and in the future ({%
    include Person content="ctrueden" %}, {% include Person
    content="fjug" %}, {% include Person content="tpietzsch" %})
      - Next stable release (December 2017) will still follow the 'old'
        way of doing things.
      - In case the DFG grant comes in and we hired the 2 people they
        will start implementing the new way of cutting stable releases.
        This will be great\!
  - How to integrate ImageJ, KNIME and machine learning frameworks
    (particularly Keras and TensorFlow)
