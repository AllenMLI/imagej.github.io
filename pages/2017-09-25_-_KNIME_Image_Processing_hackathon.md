From Wednesday, September 20, 2017 through Friday, September 28, 2017, 
of [KNIME](https://www.knime.org) hosted \~20 developers at the [KNIME
Konstanz Regional Office](https://www.knime.com/contact) for a
[hackathon](hackathon "wikilink") to develop the KNIME Image Processing
extensions along with the underlying [ImageJ Ops](ImageJ_Ops "wikilink")
library, as well as other related and/or supporting technologies such as
[Ilastik](http://ilastik.org/), [ImgLib2](ImgLib2 "wikilink") and
[BigDataViewer](BigDataViewer "wikilink").

There was a big focus this time on machine learning, particularly deep
learning networks applied to biological data.

## Participants

  - KNIME: , , Jon Fuller, , , , , , 
  - MPI-CBG Dresden: , , , , , , , 
  - Others: , , , , , , Julianus Pfeuffer, , Jonas Probst, René Rahn, 

## Hackathon progress

### Curtis Rueden

  - Worked with  on automating releases of [SciJava
    components](Architecture#Definitions "wikilink") via [Travis
    CI](Travis_CI "wikilink")
    (\[<https://github.com/scijava/scijava-scripts/compare/0235621>...f5965c3
    1\], , ).
  - Assisted  in improvements to the `imagej-maven-plugin` ()
  - Reviewed and merged 's initial revamp of the SciJava log framework
    (, ).
  - Reviewed and merged 's work adding a SciJava widget for `File[]`
    inputs (, , ).
  - With , began work on several related SciJava scripting enhancements
    ([1](https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/issues/261#issuecomment-331487719)).
  - Helped  and  with ImageJ/TensorFlow integration and API improvements
    (PR(s) to `imagej/imagej-tensorflow` forthcoming).
  - With , continued work on the next-generation SciJava Struct API,
    including an overhauled widget framework and Swing widget
    implementations (as of this writing, on an unstable branch of
    `scijava/scijava-ops` repository; see
    [here](https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/issues/42#issuecomment-332658377)
    for a written update with illustration of progress).
  - Helped  set up his  with [Travis CI](Travis_CI "wikilink") and
    deploy it to the ImageJ Maven repository.

### Florian Jug

  - Worked on a KNIME workflow that starts IsoNet-type deep nets on a
    image column. Works well now, but we want to move tiled executions
    out from python and move it into KNIME (and also Fiji). This
    follow-up work will be performed by  and .
  - Received TGMM groin truth data an started working on Tr3d demo
    dataset.
  - Started working on min cell-cycle constraints for Tr2d. This will
    make the ILP explode...
  - Discussions with ,  and  about ImageJ Conference details for 2018.

### Tim-Oliver Buchholz

  - Worked on the [Big Data Viewer
    GUI](https://github.com/knime-ip/knip-bdv).
  - Helped  and  with KNIME Image Processing Node development.
  - Fixed `DefaultDifferenceVariance` feature of the Haralick
    feature-set in `imagej-ops` ().

### Benjamin Wilhelm

  - Worked on CSBDeep Fiji Plugin.
  - Added Overlap to TiledView
    [PR](https://github.com/imglib/imglib2/pull/179) in imglib2.
  - Worked on API improvements in `imagej/imagej-tensorflow` with the
    help of .
  - Programmed KNIME Image Processing nodes which provied a loop over
    tiles of an image. See [branch on
    GitHub](https://github.com/knime-ip/knip/commits/tiling-nodes).

### Stefan Helfrich

  - Worked on improvements to the `imagej-maven-plugin` (, , )
  - Got , , and  started on integrating their SciJava Commands as KNIME
    nodes
  - Reviewed PRs of `imagej-ops` (, , ,
    [4](http://forum.imagej.net/t/frangi-vesselness-filter-feedback/6747))
  - Looked into migration of algorithms from MorphoLibJ to Ops/ImgLib2
  - Worked with  on migrating an ImageJ1 plugin to a SciJava Command
    (and possibly Ops for computations)
  - Fixed some bugs with respect to `@Parameters` (, )
  - Paired with  to push the cloud-based build and deploy infrastructure

### Tobias Pietzsch

  - Worked on imglib2 discrete regions framework (imglib2-roi branch
    ["cleaned-up"](https://github.com/imglib/imglib2-roi/tree/8bafc8de2d83531aaef46ee36964731a78204589),
    imglib-tests branch
    ["roi"](https://github.com/imglib/imglib2-tests/tree/ec0df49bf5fc344f6ae5af5fec8584a36e3d2ca2)).
  - Reviewed imglib2-roi , and worked on revision/re-implementation of
    core interfaces and operators (imglib2-roi branch
    ["troi"](https://github.com/imglib/imglib2-roi/tree/c41c93acf696b801e13f5023bf00527c04722263)).
  - Worked on reviewing and integrating "dynamic bookmarks" feature by
    [Max Kleinhenz](https://github.com/maxkleinhenz/bigdataviewer-core)
    into BigDataViewer.
  - Minor BigDataViewer features to help  with [Big Data Viewer
    GUI](https://github.com/knime-ip/knip-bdv).

### Matthias Arzt

  - Worked on revamp of the scijava logging framework.
  - Worked on LoopBuilder, as tool for writing loops on images with
    imglib2.
  - Got an introduction on KNIME Node development by Tim Oliver and
    Stefan Hilfrich
  - Created a KNIME image processing plugin for image segmentation based
    on Labkit / Trainable Segmentation.

## Technical discussions

  - Fiji component and application releases: today and in the future (,
    , )
      - Next stable release (December 2017) will still follow the 'old'
        way of doing things.
      - In case the DFG grant comes in and we hired the 2 people they
        will start implementing the new way of cutting stable releases.
        This will be great\!
  - How to integrate ImageJ, KNIME and machine learning frameworks
    (particularly Keras and TensorFlow)
