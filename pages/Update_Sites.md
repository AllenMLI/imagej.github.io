%Replace% UpdateSitesMenu %Replace% An **update site** is web space used
by the [Updater](Updater "wikilink") which enables users to share their
macros, scripts and plugins with other researchers. With update sites,
you do not need to manually download and install anything;
[ImageJ](ImageJ "wikilink") takes care of it for you.

## Following an update site

<div style="clear: right; float: right">

{% capture includecontent %} The [Fiji](Fiji "wikilink") distribution of
ImageJ ships with both the *ImageJ* and *Fiji* sites enabled. You can
transform your ImageJ installation into a Fiji one simply by enabling
the *Fiji* update site. {% endcapture %}

{% include fiji content=includecontent %}

</div>

Out of the box, ImageJ has only the core *ImageJ* update site enabled.
To enable additional features, choose {% include bc
content='Help|Update...' %}, then click the "Manage update sites"
button.

For further details, see [How to follow a 3rd party update
site](How_to_follow_a_3rd_party_update_site "wikilink").

## Creating your own update site

Anyone can share their extensions ([plugins](plugins "wikilink"),
[scripts](scripts "wikilink"), etc.) by [creating their own update
site](How_to_set_up_and_populate_an_update_site "wikilink"). You can use
ImageJ's [personal update site](personal_update_site "wikilink") service
(hosted on the [ImageJ web server](http://sites.imagej.net/)), or host
it on your own server.
