[SCIFIO](https://scif.io/) is a flexible framework for **SC**ientific
**I**mage **F**ormat **I**nput and **O**utput. In other words, it is a
library for reading and writing N-dimensional image data—e.g., to and
from files on disk. SCIFIO is built on the [SciJava
Common](SciJava_Common "wikilink") library.

[ImageJ2](ImageJ2 "wikilink") uses SCIFIO by default for most image
input tasks. You can change this behavior at any time by running  and
modifying the *Use SCIFIO when opening files* option.

## Benefits of using SCIFIO

SCIFIO is focused on robust and extensible support for reading and
writing image file formats. Using it with ImageJ provides many
advantages:

  - There is no need to call a special SCIFIO plugin; it works with
    commands like  automatically.
  - There are additional import options available via the  command.
  - There is a [Bio-Formats](Bio-Formats "wikilink") plugin for SCIFIO,
    included with the [Fiji](Fiji "wikilink") distribution of ImageJ,
    that adds automatic support for over a hundred life sciences file
    formats.
  - Additional SCIFIO file format plugins can be dropped into ImageJ and
    will also work automatically.
  - Unlike the ImageJ 1.x TIFF implementation, SCIFIO's support for TIFF
    adheres to the specification, allowing to successfully read many
    more sorts of TIFFs.
  - Similarly, SCIFIO supports more sorts of JPEG files since it uses
    its own JPEG decoder.
  - SCIFIO also ships with support for several QuickTime codecs,
    allowing ImageJ to read QuickTime MOV files even in 64-bit mode
    without QuickTime for Java.
  - SCIFIO supports many additional open file formats out of the box:
      - animated GIF
      - animated PNG
      - encapsulated postscript (EPS)
      - JPEG-2000
      - Micro-Manager datasets
      - Multi-image Network Graphics (MNG)
      - Nearly Raw Raster Data (NRRD)
      - Imspector OBF
      - OME-TIFF (multidimensional rich metadata TIFF)
      - OME-XML
      - PCX
      - PICT (even in 64-bit mode and/or without QuickTime for Java
        installed)
  - If SCIFIO cannot handle the image file, it falls back to ImageJ 1.x.
  - You can save to SCIFIO-supported file formats using the  command.
    Supported formats for export include:
      - APNG
      - AVI
      - EPS
      - ICS
      - JPEG
      - JPEG2000
      - QuickTime
      - TIFF

## Current limitations of SCIFIO

  - SCIFIO is still in beta, so there is likely to be a higher incidence
    of bugs. Issues can be reported on the [SCIFIO issue
    tracker](https://github.com/scifio/scifio/issues).
  - Although we strive for full backwards compatibility, some files may
    appear slightly different when opened.
  - Opening files with SCIFIO is not fully macro recordable yet.
