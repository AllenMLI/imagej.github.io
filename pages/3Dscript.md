**3Dscript** - Create high-quality 3D/4D animations using a
natural-language based syntax

In state-of-the-art 3D rendering and animation software the user
typically creates an animation by specifying a number of keyframes.
While intuitive, this approach becomes tedious for complex motions like
simultaneous rotations around multiple axes, and even worse for
accelerated and decelerated motions: The number of required keyframes
increases, and creating them becomes hardly reproducible.

In 3Dscript, animations are defined by a syntax based on natural English
language, in sentences such as "From frame 0 to frame 100 rotate by 360
degrees horizontally ease-in".

## Installation

  - Click on Help\>Update...
  - Click on Manage update sites
  - Click on Add update site
  - Enter Name: 3Dscript
  - Enter URL: https://romulus.oice.uni-erlangen.de/updatesite/
  - Click on Close
  - Click on Apply changes
  - Restart Fiji

## Quick start

  - Click on File\>Open Samples\>T1 Head
  - Click on Plugins\>3D script\>Interactive Animation
  - In the "Interactive Raycaster" window, click on "show" next to
    "Animation"
  - Click on "Start text-based animation editor"
  - In the editor window, type the following text: From frame 0 to frame
    200 rotate by 360 degrees horizontally
  - Click on "Run" This will render 200 frames of a movie sequence,
    within which the MRI data set rotates by 360 degrees.

Rendering of 200 frames of this data set will typically take less than a
minute on an OpenCL-enabled Graphics Card. The resulting stack can be
saved as a video file using Fiji's File\>Save As\>AVI... command.

To run the software on another data set, open a different image stack
(instead of the T1 Head sample data) before running 3Dscript.
