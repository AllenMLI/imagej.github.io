## Video tutorial on the basic recipe for TrakEM2

![TrakEM2 basic tutorial](Screenshot-TrakEM2_basics_tutorial.png
"TrakEM2 basic tutorial")

This is the [basic tutorial for
TrakEM2](TrakEM2_basics_tutorial "wikilink"). **If you are new to
TrakEM2, please start by watching [this
tutorial](TrakEM2_basics_tutorial "wikilink")**. It includes:

  - Importing an image stack.
  - Registering stack slices manually, using color overlays and affine
    transforms.
  - Defining a template tree structure for your segmentations.
  - Segmenting cells across multiple sections.
  - 3D visualization.

## Video tutorial on segmenting/outlining objects over multiple sections in 3D

![TrakEM2 brushing (This video tutorial was made by Albert Cardona. To
visualize it, you need a mp4 player.)](Arealists-brushing.jpg
"TrakEM2 brushing (This video tutorial was made by Albert Cardona. To visualize it, you need a mp4 player.)")
This mp4 [video
tutorial](http://www.ini.uzh.ch/~acardona/movies/arealist-create-and-edit.mp4)
covers:

  - How to use the PEN tool with "area lists" segmentation type (paint
    an area, flood-fill, erase, flood-erase).
  - How to use ROIs (selections like polygon and freeroi) to edit "area
    lists".

See also the list of [key bindings for
AreaList](http://www.ini.uzh.ch/~acardona/trakem2_manual.html#edit_arealist).

## Video tutorial on aligning sections

![TrakEM2 align sections
tutorial](Screenshot-TrakEM2_align_sections_tutorial.png
"TrakEM2 align sections tutorial")

[This video tutorial](TrakEM2_align_sections_tutorial "wikilink") is
focused on:

  - Automatically registering sections.
  - Selecting feature extraction parameters.

See also the feature extraction and alignment [parameters
explained](http://www.ini.uzh.ch/~acardona/howto.html#sift_parameters).

## Video tutorial on manual segmentation modes

![TrakEM2 manual segmentation

"TrakEM2 manual segmentation modes")

[Tutorial on how to manually segment cells using the 3 segmentation
modes](TrakEM2_segmentation_modes_tutorial "wikilink"):

  - Overlap  
    multiple arealists can coexist in space (the normal mode; arealists
    are independent).
  - Exclude  
    when painting in an arealist, do not allow paint to occur over any
    other existing arealist.
  - Erode  
    when painting in an arealist, paint in the current but erase any
    other arealist.

## Video tutorial on semi-automatic segmentation

![TrakEM2 semi-automatic
segmentation](Screenshot-TrakEM2-tutorial-automatic-segmentation.png
"TrakEM2 semi-automatic segmentation")

In [this video
tutorial](TrakEM2_semi-automatic_segmentation_tutorial "wikilink") you
will learn:

  - How to segment cells by only one click.
  - Fast marching method tool in TrakEM2.
  - Selecting segmentation parameters.

## Video tutorial on measuring surfaces and volumes

![TrakEM2 measuring surfaces and
volumes](Screenshot-TrakEM2-tutorial-measure-surfaces.png
"TrakEM2 measuring surfaces and volumes")

In [this video tutorial](TrakEM2_measurements_tutorial "wikilink") you
will learn how to:

  - Extract information from TrakEM2 project objects.
  - Save measurements into files.

See also [AreaList
measurements](http://www.ini.uzh.ch/~acardona/trakem2_manual.html#measure_arealist)
in the TrakEM2 manual, with figures.

## Video tutorial on adding sections/layers to an existing project

![TrakEM2 adding layers to existing
project](Screenshot-TrakEM2-tutorial-add-layers.png
"TrakEM2 adding layers to existing project")

[Here](TrakEM2_add_more_sections/layers_tutorial "wikilink") you will
learn how to:

  - Open an image sequence as a virtual stack in Fiji.
  - Calibrate the virtual stack.
  - Import the virtual stack into TrakEM2 as a sequence of layers
    (sections), one image per layer.

In the tutorial, the layers are imported following an existing set of
layers, i.e. concatenating to enlarge the collection of sections.

## Video tutorial on saving a project

![TrakEM2 saving a project](Screenshot-TrakEM2-save-project.png
"TrakEM2 saving a project")

  - [Saving a TrakEM2
    project](TrakEM2_saving_project_tutorial "wikilink") into an .XML
    file.
