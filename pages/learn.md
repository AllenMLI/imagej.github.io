Paragraph 1: While in Clojure one is able to declare types if desired, it's not required; the low computational requirements of the plugin do not invite to make it verbose unnecessarily. But java demands type declarations just so that the plugin can be compiled and thus a binary .class file generated.

## Section example 1

Paragraph 2: While both the java and clojure versions encapsulate the variables in a local namespace -in Clojure, by using let statements to declare local variables-, the jython version does not, so they are all global when defined outside the class definition. One can achieve, though, variable encapsulation by declaring the entire script inside a class or function definition -but its not required as in java, neither as natural and straightforward as in Clojure.
