This is a first *alpha* release of the [script
editor](SoC_2009_Ideas#Add_a_simple_yet_minimally_powerful_plugin_and_script_editor "wikilink")
that was one of our [Google Summer of
Code](2009-04-20_-_Summer_of_Code:_We_got_us_three_students "wikilink")
projects.

While it was pretty well stress-tested in the [Fiji
School](2009-08-04_-_Fiji_School_-_Last_Call_for_Student_Applications "wikilink"),
and while it works pretty well for some of the Fiji developers, it is
more like a technology preview.

Having said all that, if you are interested in scripting Fiji, just use
the [Fiji Updater](Update_Fiji "wikilink") and [give it a
shot](Using_the_Script_Editor "wikilink")\!

Speaking of shots: here is a screenshot:
