isnt much of this obsoleted in imageJ2, in that the script editor can no onger compile and run .java????

Yeah, there is a mix of still-relevant, and now-obsolete information. Note that the Script Editor still *can* compile and run Java code. But we are really phasing out usage of the Fiji/ImageJ launcher to do that stuff, in favor of properly structured Maven projects (which the Script Editor can actually generate for you...). Anyway, for now I just slapped the Outdated template on it as a warning. [Rueden](User:Rueden "wikilink") ([talk](User_talk:Rueden "wikilink"))
