Today, the ImageJ team has launched a unified site for searching ImageJ
resources, including web, code, issues, mailing lists and more.

The site is:

<div style="padding-left: 30px; font-size: 24px">

http://search.imagej.net/

</div>

The source code can be found {% include github org='imagej'
repo='imagej-search' %}. Everyone is welcome to contribute any
improvements.

We hope this site makes it easier for the community to quickly locate
information about ImageJ.
