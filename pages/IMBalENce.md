# **Overview**

This is a suite of ImageJ plugins that are used for processing images acquired from electron microscopes. Currently the main focus is on SEM images, but I will keep working on streamline the image processing of both SEM and TEM data.

# **Components and Functions**

Click the links below to find more about each tool.

1.  \[ [SEM FEI metadata and scale](SEM_FEI_metadata_scale "wikilink") \] reads FEI SEM acquisition metadata from tiff tags and set image scale based on pixel size.
2.  \[ [SEM FEI databar cut](SEM_FEI_databar_cut "wikilink") \] cuts databar from FEI SEM images, then save image and databar as individual files. (Page in preparation)
3.  \[ [SEM JOEL Scale](SEM_JOEL_Scale "wikilink") \] sets image scale based on pixel size store in the .txt file associated with SEM image.
4.  \[ [SEM ZEISS metadata scale](SEM_Zeiss_metadata_scale "wikilink") \] reads ZEISS SEM acquisition metadata from tiff tags and set image scale based on pixel size.
5.  \[ [SEM Hitachi metadata scale](SEM_Hitachi_metadata_scale "wikilink") \] Upcoming soon...
6.  \[ [Image feature measurement annotation](Image_Annotation "wikilink") \] measures and mark the size of features. It annotates the length of line tool in a calibrated image and export measurement results.
7.  \[ [Flat field correction](Flat_field_correction "wikilink") \] Applies flat filed correction to a folder of images for large area mapping to mitigate chess pattern after stitching. (Page in preparation)
8.  \[ [ TEM .ser .dm3 folder export](TIA_.ser_folder_export "wikilink") \] This tool convert TIA EM image .ser files and Gatan .dm3 files in a folder to TIFF format.

# **Installation**

## Installation via FIJI updater

1\. [FIJI](https://fiji.sc) (Fiji Is Just ImageJ) should be installed on your computer.

2\. Click “Help / Update…” to open the FIJI updater. If it’s the first time updating your FIJI, it might take some time to download the update files and may also require to restart FIJI a few times. Once done, click “Help / Update…” again to bring up the ImageJ updater window.

## Manual Installation

If you only want to use one of the plugins you can follow these steps:

1\. The source code of these macro scripts can be viewed on [my github page](https://github.com/IMBalENce/EM-tool).

2\. Download the plugin you want.

3\. Save .ijm files in the desired location within your imageJ application

4\. Go to "Plugins/Macros/install..." to add the macros, or drag-and-drop the .ijm file into ImageJ/FIJI
