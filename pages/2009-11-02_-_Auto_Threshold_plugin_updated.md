The [Auto\_Threshold](https://fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/Auto_Threshold) plugin has been updated (v1.9). There is a new second iso-data algorithm available that takes the total to 16 different methods of global histogram image segmentation. **Default** is the original method found in ImageJ while **IsoData** is another variation of the same principle.
