{% include toc content='right' %}Here you can
[download](https://downloads.imagej.net/ImageJ2-20160205.zip) an "all
platforms" version of ImageJ, without a bundled Java or extra
extensions.

{% include sidebox-right content='Unfortunately, due to the ongoing
transition from Java 6 to Java 8, this download of "plain ImageJ2"
cannot currently be updated to the latest Java-8-compatible version. See
the [Java 8](Java_8 "wikilink") page for details. For the time being, we
recommend [using the Fiji distribution of
ImageJ](Fiji/Downloads "wikilink") to stay current with updates.' %}
