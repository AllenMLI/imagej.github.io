## Status of ImageJ on Android

The Android operating system uses a modified version of the Java virtual
machine. So in principle, running ImageJ on Android devices is feasible.
However, running ImageJ on Android does not currently work, because:

  - [ImageJ 1.x](ImageJ_1.x "wikilink") uses AWT, which is not available
    on Android
  - [ImageJ2](ImageJ2 "wikilink") was built with a separation of
    concerns in mind (see [Architecture](Architecture "wikilink") page
    for technical details), but there is no infrastructure in place to
    ensure that all ImageJ2 APIs are Android-compatible. It would be a
    feasible project, but potentially a lot of work, to do that. The
    community would welcome efforts in this direction\!

See [this forum
thread](https://forum.image.sc/t/using-imagej-with-android/2517) for
further details and discussion.
