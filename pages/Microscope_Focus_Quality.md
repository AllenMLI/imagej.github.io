{% include component content=includecontent %} This plugin assesses the
focus quality of microscope images, classifying the image in tiles.

## Summary

The plugin predicts an absolute measure of image focus on a single image
in isolation, without any user-specified parameters. It uses a
pre-trained deep neural network, operating at the image-patch level, and
also outputs a measure of prediction certainty, enabling interpretable
predictions.

## Installation

  - [Enable](Following_an_update_site "wikilink") the TensorFlow [update
    site](update_site "wikilink").
  - The command is in {% include bc content='Plugins | Classification |
    Microscope Image Focus Quality'%}.

## Usage

  - Open an image to analyze (see [sample
    images](https://storage.googleapis.com/microscope-image-quality/static/fiji_plugin_test_images.zip)).
  - Run {% include bc content='Plugins | Classification | Microscope
    Image Focus Quality'%}.
  - A dialog will appear allowing you to configure the output
    visualization. The following options are available:
      - **Generate probability image** - When checked, a multi-channel
        image will be created with one channel per focus level, and each
        value corresponding to the probability of that sample being at
        that focus level.
      - **Overlay probability patches** - When checked, each classified
        region of the image will be overlaid with a color whose hue
        denotes the most likely focus level and whose brightness denotes
        the confidence (i.e., probability) of the region being at that
        level.
      - **Show patches as solid rectangles** - When checked, overlaid
        probability patches will be filled semi-transparent and solid;
        when unchecked, they will be drawn as hollow boundary boxes.
      - **Displayed patch border width** - When drawing probability
        patches as boundary boxes, this option controls the box
        thickness.

The screenshot above uses the "Overlay probability patches" option with
a thickness of 5.

If you wish to access the results of the classification quantitatively
(e.g., as part of an automated workflow via
[scripting](scripting "wikilink")), use the "Generate probability image"
option.

You can can remove the probability patches overlay via the {% include bc
content='Image | Overlay | Remove Overlay'%} command.

## Limitations

The plugin is currently limited to single (i.e., 2D) images of 16-bit
integer data only. The model was trained with images in the intensity
range of `[0, ~10000]`; your mileage may vary if the input image
intensities diverge from that too greatly.
