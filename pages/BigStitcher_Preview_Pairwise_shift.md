The second step of the stitching process after the pairwise shifts
between views has been calculated is previewing the links and
correlation coefficients. It is important to screen the results and
remove erroneous links.

If you are running the **Stitching Wizard**, you will be taken to
**Interactive Link Explorer** immediately after calculating pairwise
shifts. Otherwise, you can find the link verification functions in the
right-click menu under **Step-by-step Stitching**:

  - **Interactive Link Explorer ...** will open a window allowing you to
    preview the calculated pairwise shifts, filer them based on criteria
    such as cross correlation and remove individual bad links.

work on the views selected in the main window, the others will be grayed
out while it is open' %}

  - **Filter Links by Parameters ...** offers the same functionality as
    the Interactive Link explorer in a simple dialog without any live
    preview.
  - **Remove Links** allows you to remove the calculated shifts, either
    for the currently selected views or for all views.

## Interactive Link Explorer

The Interactive Link Explorer allows you to to preview the pairwise
links of a view. If you select a view in the main window, its pairwise
links will be displayed in the Interactive Link Explorer window.

  - If the BigDataViewer is open, you can see a preview of the
    transformations for the selected view and its neighbours. At the
    same time in the **Interactive Link Explorer** window, the
    calculated cross correlation value and calculated shift will appear.
      - Here, you can also filter links by correlation coefficient,
        shift dimensions or shift magnitude.
      - Selecting a single view pair in the Link Explorer will highlight
        the two views in the BigDataViewer
      - Right-clicking on a link in the link explorer brings up a menu
        that allows you to remove this specific link.

<!-- end list -->

  - In the link explorer window you can set a minimum and maximum value
    for the **cross correlation** of the shifts.
  - You can also set filters for **maximum** shift in any dimension or
    the total shift magnitude.

<!-- end list -->

  - Apply your filtering criteria to the actual views by clicking
    **Apply Filter**.

<!-- end list -->

  - Once you are satisfied with the results, you can click **Apply & Run
    Global Optimization** to continue with the [global
    optimization](BigStitcher_Global_optimization "wikilink")
    immediately.
