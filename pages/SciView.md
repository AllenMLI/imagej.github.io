\== Purpose ==

This plugin provides 3D visualization and virtual reality capabilities
for images and meshes using the
[Scenery](https://github.com/scenerygraphics/scenery). SciView
integrates [ImageJ2](ImageJ2 "wikilink") functionality, including
[ImageJ Ops](ImageJ_Ops "wikilink") and [ImageJ
Mesh](ImageJ_Mesh "wikilink"), to provide the ability to interact with
image and mesh data in 3D and interface with the popular
[Fiji](Fiji "wikilink") software ecosystem.

An update site is available: <http://sites.imagej.net/SciView/>

There have been a number of contributors to the project: Stephan
Saalfeld, Tobias Pietzsch, Loic Royer, and Robert Haase. Development has
taken place at hackathons such as the first [SciView
hackathon](2018-04-04_22-_SciView_hackathon "wikilink")).
