Development of ImageJ and related software relies heavily on
[Git](http://git-scm.com/). See the [source
code](source_code "wikilink") page for information on where the Git
repositories reside.

## Why do we use Git?

  - Git is a first-class
    [distributed](wikipedia:Distributed_version_control "wikilink")
    [version control](wikipedia:Version_control "wikilink") system, so
    we use it to keep a record of changes to avoid loss-of-work and to
    appropriately explain/document changes as projects develop.
  - Git history, which is composed of "snapshots" of the source code,
    can be used to go back at any point in time, which leads to
    reproducible science.

This web site has lots of tutorials on Git; see the left sidebar.

## Rewriting history

One of the most powerful things Git can do is rewrite a series of
patches after the fact. This is a powerful technique worth learning.
There are many guides available here and elsewhere:
