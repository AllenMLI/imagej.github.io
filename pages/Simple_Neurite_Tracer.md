 The ImageJ framework for semi-automated tracing of neurons and tubular
structures. %Replace% TOC %Replace%

## Introduction

SNT is designed to allow easy semi-automatic tracing of neurons or other
tube-like structures (e.g., blood vessels) through 3D image stacks. The
plugin has built-in tools for analysis and hardware accelerated 3D
visualization of the results. Data can be imported and exported in SWC
files for interaction with other software, or details of the traces can
be exported as CSV files for analysis in spreadsheets or statistical
software. The [native file format](#Technical_Documentation "wikilink")
is open and XML-based. This plugin is Free Software (also known as Open
Source software).

{% include Tip content="tip = You need a [Java 8-enabled
installation](#Installation "wikilink") to run the latest version of
SNT. If you are not familiar with the plugin, have a look at its
[Introductory
Screencast](Simple_Neurite_Tracer:_Introductory_Screencast "wikilink")
and [Tutorials](#Tutorials "wikilink")." %}

## Installation

SNT is part of Fiji and distributed through the Java 8 [ update
site](How_to_follow_a_3rd_party_update_site#Add_update_sites "wikilink").
If you are not running a Java 8 -enabled installation you should
[download the latest Fiji release](Downloads "wikilink"). Newer releases
come pre-bundled with Java 8, and are already subscribed to the [Java-8
update site](User:Java-8 "wikilink"). Once installed you should run {%
include bc content="Help | Update Fiji" %} to make sure that you have
the most recent version. You can find the plugin in {% include bc
content="Plugins | NeuroAnatomy | SNT" %} (or by bringing up the
[Command Finder](Using_the_Command_Launcher "wikilink") and typing  ).

## Feedback

Please report any bugs that you find in the
[forum](https://forum.image.sc/tags/snt) or on
[GitHub](https://github.com/fiji/Simple_Neurite_Tracer/issues).

## Tutorials

Hopefully, you should be able to use this software easily by following
the suggested next steps in the top left of the main dialog. However, to
use the plugin more effectively, you may want to use some of the
following materials:

**Other Material:**

    There are also a couple of older screencasts available - these refer
    to obsolete pre-release versions, but most of the functionality
    demonstrated is still present:

## Technical Documentation

The native file format of the plugin is documented at: [SNT: .traces
File Format](SNT:_.traces_File_Format "wikilink"). (`.traces` files are
just gzipped XML, so easy to parse.) There's also an example {% include
GitHub
content="org=tferr|repo=hIPNAT|path=src/main/resources/scripts/|label=script"
%} on the [Neuroanatomy](Neuroanatomy "wikilink") update site showing
how to batch convert each .traces file to multiple SWC files.

SNT is also easy to use programmatically. For instance, the example in
{% include GitHub
content="org=fiji|repo=Simple\_Neurite\_Tracer|source=tracing/Albert\_Test.java|label=Albert\_Test.java"
%} shows how to use the code to find a path between two arbitrary points
in an image stack.

As another small example, if you just wanted to load a set of SWC files
using the SNT API and display them in the 3D viewer (a functionality
provided by the [Neuroanatomy](Neuroanatomy "wikilink") update site,
through a {% include GitHub
content="org=tferr|repo=hIPNAT|path=src/main/java/ipnat/|label=Java
plugin" %}), a Jython script like [this](https://gist.github.com/838695)
will do.

## Authors

The current version was written by [Tiago
Ferreira](User:Tiago "wikilink"). The first release of Simple Neurite
Tracer was written by [Mark Longair](User:Mark "wikilink") except for
the following important sections, released under the GPL:

  - The code for doing Gaussian convolutions of the image and the
    calculation of principal curvatures was written by [Stephan
    Preibisch](User:StephanP "wikilink").
  - The code for loading AmiraMesh label files was written by [Johannes
    Schindelin](User:Schindelin "wikilink").
  - The code for generating meshes of neurons for the 3D viewer was
    originally written by [Albert
    Cardona](User:Albertcardona "wikilink") for
    [TrakEM2](TrakEM2 "wikilink").
  - This plugin also incorporates code from the LGPL licensed PAL
    library, although the functionality that relies on this is not
    currently exposed.

## Acknowledgments

This software was first developed during [Mark
Longair](User:Mark "wikilink")'s PhD, funded by the [EPSRC / MRC life
sciences interface
programme](http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/ResearchFunding/Programmes/LifeSciencesInterface/),
and in particular the [Doctoral Training Centre in Neuroinformatics at
the University of
Edinburgh](http://www.anc.inf.ed.ac.uk/neuroinformatics/). A substantial
part of the later development of this plugin was done during the
[Janelia Farm](http://www.hhmi.org/janelia/) Hackathon of 2007. Citing
Mark: "I owe a debt of thanks to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute for
making it possible for me to go to that event. Thank-you also to Arnim
Jenett, Adrianna Teriakidis and Benny Lam for their feedback and help
with testing various versions of this plugin".
