== We work constantly on improving the Fiji and KNIME plugins. Help us
doing so by letting us know if you encounter problems.

  - **Problem:** on a Linux machine ClearVolume would not start but
    throw an ugly exception like
      -   
        `java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError at
        clearvolume.renderer.opencl.OpenCLAvailability...`.
  - **Solution:** you might not have OpenCL installed or your
    installation is corrupted.
      -   
        On Ubuntu the following instructions turned out to be useful for
        some of our users:
        http://askubuntu.com/questions/541114/how-to-make-opencl-work-on-14-10-nvidia-331-89-drivers

<!-- end list -->

  - **Problem:** on a Mac, after ClearVolume opens in Fiji I see a large
    grey area where the 3D viewer should be.
  - **Solution:** we work on a fix... so far, double click on the grey
    area to switch to full screen, then double click again to go back to
    window mode.

![The main ClearVolume plugin can render volumetric multi-channel data.
Channel LUTs, transparency, rendering quality, etc. can easily be set in
the plugins user interface. We thank Tzumin Lee's group at Janelia for
being allowed to use their twin-spot MARCM (Yu et al., Nature
Neuroscience, 2009) labeled neurons.](ClearVolumeInFiji.png

from a microscope in the basement of your collaborators

## Installing ClearVolume in Fiji or ImageJ2

1.  Download Fiji or ImageJ2 from [here](https://imagej.net/Downloads).
2.  Start Fiji/ImageJ2 and launch the updater (**Help - Update...**)
3.  Click on **Manage update sites**, tick the box next to
    **ClearVolume**, and hit **Close**.
4.  If you use an older Fiji installation you MUST also check and
    install the **Java-8** update site. For more recent Fiji
    installations this update site will already be selected.
5.  Confirm the update/installation by clicking **Apply changes** and
    restart Fiji/ImageJ as suggested by the updater.

## Other ways to use ClearVolume

  - KNIME  
    The ClearVolume team provides a plugin for [KNIME Image
    Processing](KNIME_Image_Processing "wikilink"). See [this
    page](http://tech.knime.org/book/clearvolume) for details.
  - Stand-alone  
    The original purpose of ClearVolume is to bring live volumetric
    rendering to modern microscopy. Please check the [wiki on
    GibHub](https://clearvolume.github.io/ClearVolume/) for detailed
    informations.
