#### Interactive Prompt

These shortcuts are always available:

  - \- Confirms the current temporary path. *Mnemonic: <u>Y</u>es*.

<!-- end list -->

  - \- Discards the current temporary path. *Mnemonic: <u>N</u>o*.

<!-- end list -->

  - \- Finishes a path. Note that you can finish a path by pressing 
    twice.

<!-- end list -->

  - \- Cancels a path. Note that you can finish a path by pressing 
    twice.

<!-- end list -->

  - \- Aborts current operation / Exits current mode

#### Tracing

These shortcuts are available when running SNT in *Tracing Mode*:

  - \- Toggles <u>H</u>essian calculation of Path curvatures.

<!-- end list -->

  - \- Toggles tracing on filtered <u>I</u>mage.

<!-- end list -->

  - \- Finds the brightest voxel (<u>M</u>aximum) above and below the
    current x,y position and automatically clicks on it. If multiple
    maxima exist, their average positioning is used. Note that this
    feature assumes that neurites are brighter than the background.

<!-- end list -->

  - \- Toggles cursor <u>S</u>napping: If enabled, the plugin will
    automatically move the cursor to the brightest voxel within the
    specified x,y,z snapping window<sup>1</sup>. This facilitates
    accurate [positioning of path
    points](Simple_Neurite_Tracer:_Accurate_point_placement "wikilink")
    and it is described in more detail in this
    [issue](https://github.com/fiji/Simple_Neurite_Tracer/issues/1).

<!-- end list -->

  - \-click - Selects a point along the active path to be used as
    forking point (See [step-by-step
    instructions](SNT:_Step-By-Step_Instructions#Branching:_Start_A_Path_On_An_Existing_Path "wikilink")
    for more details on joining and branching).

#### Navigation and Zoom

These shortcuts are always available:

  - \- Synchronizes XY, ZY, and XZ views while moving the cursor when
    not using cursor snapping.

<!-- end list -->

  - \- Zooms in (Simultaneously on all views) (IJ default).

<!-- end list -->

  - \- Zooms out (Simultaneously on all views) (IJ default).

<!-- end list -->

  - \- Displays tracing view(s) at original scale (IJ default).

<!-- end list -->

  - \- Displays tracing view(s) at 100% (IJ default).

<!-- end list -->

  - \- Activates the Pan (Hand) tool (IJ default).

<!-- end list -->

  - /  - Previous/Next Z-slice, or Previous/Next channel, depending on
    the *Reverse CZT oder of "\>" and "\<"* choice set in IJ's  prompt
    (IJ default).

<!-- end list -->

  - \- Shuttles the window focus between the tracing image and the SNT
    window.

#### Path Handling

These shortcuts are always available:

  - \- Toggles the first visibility filter: Whether all traced paths
    should be displayed or just selected ones

<!-- end list -->

  - \- Toggles the second visibility filter: Whether all nodes should be
    displayed across the Z-stack or just those in nearby Z-slices

<!-- end list -->

  - \- Toggles the third visibility filter: Whether paths from all
    channels/frames should be displayed or just those in the active
    channel/frame

<!-- end list -->

  - \- Selects the nearest path to the mouse cursor. Holding  adds the
    path nearest to the mouse cursor to the current list of selected
    paths. *Mnemonic: <u>G</u>roup paths around cursor.* Note that Paths
    can only be edited one at a time, and thus  is disabled in *Edit
    Mode*.

#### Path Editing

These shortcuts become available in *Edit Mode*, activated through the
contextual menu (displayed when right-clicking on a tracing canvas):

  - or  - <u>D</u>eletes the active node.

  - or  - <u>I</u>nserts a new node at cursor position.

  - \- <u>M</u>oves active node to cursor position.

  - \- <u>B</u>rings active node to current Z-plane.

#### Reconstruction Viewer

  -    - Rotate (with mouse: Left-click & drag)

  -  - Zoom (with mouse: Scroll wheel)

  - \- Toggle <u>A</u>xes

  - \- Toggle <u>C</u>amera Mode

  - \- Toggle <u>D</u>ark Mode

  - \- <u>F</u>it View to Visible Objects

  - \- <u>L</u>og Scene Controls to Console

  - \- <u>R</u>eset View

  - \- Save <u>S</u>creenshot

  - \- <u>H</u>elp (as Notification) ( shows Help on a dedicated window)

#### SciView

  - Drag - Move around

  - \+Drag - Rotate around selected node

  - Single-click - Select node

  - Double-click - Centers clicked node

  - \+Scroll - Zoom

  -    - Move around (hold  for slow movement)

See [SciView](SciView "wikilink")'s menu for a full list of shortcuts.

#### Legacy 3D Viewer

All shortcuts that are not specific to tracing canvases (XY, ZY and XZ
views) *should* be recognized by the [Legacy 3D
viewer](SNT:_Step-By-Step_Instructions#Legacy_3D_Viewer "wikilink"). In
addition the following are also implemented:

  - \- Selects the <u>H</u>and (rotation) tool.

  - \- Selects the <u>W</u>and (selection) tool.

  - \- Shuttles between the Hand and Wand tool after both have been
    selected at least once.

#### Other

There are other key and mouse combinations used in e.g., \[\[SNT: Sholl
Analysis\], and [Branching and Joining
Paths](SNT:_Step-By-Step_Instructions#Branching:_Start_A_Path_On_An_Existing_Path "wikilink"),
that are listed in the contextual menu, displayed when righ-clicking a
tracing canvas.
