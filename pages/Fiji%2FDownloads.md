{% include project content='Fiji' %}

<span id="Fiji"></span> [Fiji](Fiji "wikilink") is a distribution of
ImageJ which includes many useful plugins [contributed by the
community](Fiji_contribution_requirements "wikilink").

{% include downloadfiji %}

# System requirements

Fiji is supported on the following systems:

  - Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8 and 10
  - Mac OS X 10.8 "Mountain Lion" or later
  - Linux on amd64 and x86 architectures

However, Fiji (like ImageJ) should run on any system for which a Java 8
runtime is available (Solaris, Raspbian, etc.).

# Installation

{% include avoidprogramfiles %} {% include sidebox-right title='Packages
for Debian / Ubuntu' float='right' text='

We used to offer Debian packages of Fiji. Unfortunately, for a variety
of reasons, we are withdrawing support for these packages until such
time as someone is able to maintain them properly, so please switch to
using the Linux downloads above instead.

If you are a Debian packaging expert who would like to address this
situation, we would love to have your helpâ€”please join us in
[chat](chat "wikilink") or on the
[forum](http://forum.imagej.net/c/development).

' %} Fiji is distributed as a [portable
application](wikipedia:Portable_application "wikilink"). That means that
you do not have to run an installer; just download, unpack and start it.

# Troubleshooting

  - Many common questions are answered on the [FAQ](FAQ "wikilink").
  - If you encounter bugs, please see the [Getting
    Help](Help "wikilink") page.

# Source code

See the [source code](source_code "wikilink") page for details on
obtaining the Fiji source code.

# Other downloads

## Archive

You can download previous Fiji builds by date stamp from the
[archive](https://downloads.imagej.net/fiji/archive/).

## Life-Line Fiji versions

This sections offers older downloads of Fiji, preserved just prior to
introducing major changes. The idea is that if something goes horribly
wrong, you can fall back to a stable version.

### Java 8

Here are Life-Line versions of Fiji created after the switch to Java 8.
