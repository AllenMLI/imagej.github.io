## Purpose

Sets the thresholds for colocalization analysis, and also calculates
Manders coefficients, 2D histogram / scatter plot, and other stats.

## Documentation

<span style="color:red">Note: this plugin is now deprecated. You should
use the newer [Coloc 2](Coloc_2 "wikilink") plugin instead.</span>

See the great documentation for this plugin at [Colocalization
Analysis\#Colocalization\_Threshold](Colocalization_Analysis#Colocalization_Threshold "wikilink").
The method is that implemented in Costes et al. This uses a Pearson's
correlation above and below the thresholds to iteratively find where the
correlation between the two images is 0 and sets the thresholds there.
It is pretty robust and importantly is reproducible and non subjective.

Use of this plugin should be followed by use of the [Colocalization
Test](Colocalization_Test "wikilink") plugin, to see of the results are
statistically significant and better then random overlap of the signal
in the images.

See also the [Colocalization
Analysis](Colocalization_Analysis "wikilink") tutorial.
