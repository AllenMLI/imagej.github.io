## Presentation.

MaMuT is an end user plugin that combines the
[BigDataViewer](BigDataViewer "wikilink") and
[TrackMate](TrackMate "wikilink") to provide an application that allow
browsing, annotating and curating annotations for large image data.

"MaMuT_presentation.png")

The main window resembles the display panel of
[TrackMate](TrackMate "wikilink"). It controls how the annotations are
displayed. Using the *MaMuT Viewer* button, several views of the data
can be launched. They will all be in sync. Each of them is an instance
of the [BigDataViewer](BigDataViewer "wikilink").

We privileged annotations that are like lineages, or object followed
over time (which is what [TrackMate](TrackMate "wikilink") does). MaMuT
ships [TrackScheme](TrackScheme "wikilink"), the lineage browser taken
from TrackMate.

However, MaMuT itself does not ship any fully-automated or tracking
algorithm. It is meant for manual or semi-automatic annotation. Still,
we made the GUI comfortable enough so that you can quickly generate
rather large annotations. A semi-automated segmentation can help you
generating quickly lineage branches from single cells.

## User documentation.

The following pages are tutorials that will guide you through MaMuT and
walk you though its features.

  - [Getting started with MaMuT](Getting_started_with_MaMuT "wikilink")
    is an introduction tutorial. It will show you how to prepare a
    dataset for MaMuT and make your first annotations with it.

  - [Example mamut.properties
    file](Example_mamut.properties_file "wikilink") contains an example
    of a `mamut.properties` file, that is used to customize the
    key-bindings in the MaMuT viewer.
