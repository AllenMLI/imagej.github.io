Thanks to Alexander Wende and Tim Cross, the Fiji Wiki has a new look
and feel (named ["Viti Levu"](wikipedia:Viti_Levu "wikilink")). {%
include person content='Iarganda' %} also had a big hand in debugging
and enhancing it.

In the same run, it must be mentioned that [Benjamin
Schmid](http://www.neurofly.de/) put in a <u>lot</u> of work to make the
nice new snapshots happen, by accomodating the new {% include github
repo='fiji' path='bin/prepare-wiki-screenshot.py' label='generator' %}
with the 3D viewer's API.

Stephan Saalfeld made the menu work on the iPhone (click/tap on a menu
button and the menu will stay open).
