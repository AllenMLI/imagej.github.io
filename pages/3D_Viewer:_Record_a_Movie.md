## How to animate the universe and create movies

You can download example source code for this HowTo
[here](3D_Viewer:_Example_code "wikilink").

It is very easy to animate the virtual universe and to record the
animation, so that it can be stored as a video file and as such easily
embedded into presentations.

The following lines show an easy example:

``` java
    // Add the image as a volume
    univ.addVoltex(imp);


    // animate the universe
    univ.startAnimation();


    // record a 360 degree rotation around the y-axis
    ImagePlus movie = univ.record360();
    movie.show();
    univ.pauseAnimation();
```

The call to the universe's `record()` method returns an `ImagePlus`,
which consists of a stack of successive frames of a full 360 degree
animation.

ImageJ provides methods to save such a stack for example as AVI file or
as animated GIF.
