One of the most useful functions of ImageJ is the *Command Launcher*
(also known as *Command Finder*). The keyboard shortcut is + (or + on
Macs).

Once the window opens, just type part of the menu item you want to
launch, and it will show you a list of commands that match that
substring:

![Snapshot\_of\_the\_Command\_Launcher.png](Snapshot_of_the_Command_Launcher.png
"Snapshot_of_the_Command_Launcher.png")

If you are not quite sure about the spelling, just click on the *Fuzzy
matching* checkbox:

![Snapshot\_of\_the\_fuzzy\_Command\_Launcher.png](Snapshot_of_the_fuzzy_Command_Launcher.png
"Snapshot_of_the_fuzzy_Command_Launcher.png")

If you want to know what menu the entries are in, or from which .jar
files they come, enable the *full information*:

![Snapshot\_of\_full\_info\_Command\_Launcher.png](Snapshot_of_full_info_Command_Launcher.png
"Snapshot_of_full_info_Command_Launcher.png")
