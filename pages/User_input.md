{% include learn content='scripting' %}Even though one could use any Java library to present a graphical user interface (GUI) for a script or plugin, there are mostly 2 recommended ways to collect input from the user in ImageJ. Both methods can be used with all [available scripting languages](Scripting#Supported_languages "wikilink"), including the [ImageJ macro language](Macros "wikilink").

## Script Parameters

![Script-parameters.png](/images/pages/Script-parameters.png "Script-parameters.png")" [Script parameters](Script_parameters "wikilink") are a fast, succinct option to make a GUI in ImageJ and beyond. Scripts written using the `#@` parameter syntax can also be consumed by other tools in the [SciJava](SciJava "wikilink") ecosystem, including [KNIME](KNIME "wikilink"), [OMERO](OMERO "wikilink") and others. They are independent of user interface, meaning alternative GUIs coded in other frameworks—such as [ImageJFX](ImageJFX "wikilink") coded using JavaFX—can also present a GUI for your plugin/script that matches the application.

Each parameter (integer, string input, etc.) corresponds to a user interface element, and is created by using a generic notation in the form `#@ ParameterType variableName` that is put at the top of the script.

There are as many notations/lines as there are items to put in the GUI, and the items are rendered vertically in the resulting interface, in the order of appearance in the code.

See the [script parameters](script_parameters "wikilink") page for further details.

## GenericDialog

![Multi-column-dialog.png](/images/pages/Multi-column-dialog.png "Multi-column-dialog.png")" The [GenericDialog](generic_dialog "wikilink") class—part of [ImageJ1](ImageJ1 "wikilink")—offers more flexibility than the [script parameters](script_parameters "wikilink"), including custom layout and buttons, but requires more coding—e.g., successive calls to the plugin do not automatically remember previously entered values. Plugins coded using `GenericDialog` are also not automatically usable in other [SciJava](SciJava "wikilink") tools such as [KNIME](KNIME "wikilink") or [ImageJFX](ImageJFX "wikilink").

See the [generic dialog](generic_dialog "wikilink") page for further details.
