## Purpose

This plugin allows the user to apply four different automatic
thresholding algorithms. The four algorithms are ImageJ's built in
IsoData algorithm, [Maximum Entropy
Threshold](Maximum_Entropy_Threshold "wikilink"), [Otsu
Thresholding](Otsu_Thresholding "wikilink"), and [Mixture
Modeling](Mixture_Modeling_Thresholding "wikilink"). More information
about thresholding and the algorithms employed here can be found at the
[Image Thresholding
Tutorial](http://www.ph.tn.tudelft.nl/Courses/FIP/noframes/fip-Segmenta.html).

## Usage

This plugin is quite convenient, for it groups different techniques in
one. It has nevertheless a major drawback when used on stacks. When
operating on a stack, it computes the threshold on the *single* image
currently displayed, and will apply this threshold value to *all* of the
other images, which might not be relevant.
