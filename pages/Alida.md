Alida, the *Advanced Library for Integrated Development of Data Analysis
Applications*, defines a concept for designing libraries and toolkits in
data analysis. It supports and simplifies integrated algorithm
development by inherently joining algorithm implementation, automatic
process documentation and fully generic generation of user interfaces.

Alida offers a Java implementation of its concept subsuming basic
functionality for implementing data analysis operators, automatic
creation of corresponding graphical and command line user interfaces,
and automatic documentation of image analysis procedures.

In addition, the Java library includes *Grappa*, a graphical editor for
data analysis workflow design.

Alida is the basis of the image processing toolbox
[MiToBo](MiToBo "wikilink").
