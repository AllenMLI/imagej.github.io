Before an image can be analyzed, it needs to be opened properly. The way
scientific image data can be stored varies wildly - with custom formats
as numerous as the different brands and models of instruments used in
their acquisition. Therefore, supporting a wide variety of formats is
critical to the success of an image analysis platform like
ImageJ.[ImageJ2](ImageJ2 "wikilink") provides a comprehensive solution
to the issue of data formats in the form of [SCIFIO](SCIFIO "wikilink")
data format plugins. [SCIFIO](SCIFIO "wikilink"), the SCientific Image
Format Input and Output library, is a flexible framework for image
format support. To get started writing SCIFIO formats:

  - Check out the [SCIFIO
    tutorials](https://github.com/scifio/scifio-tutorials/tree/master/core/src/main/java/io/scif/tutorials/core).
  - Look at simple [existing
    formats](https://github.com/scifio/scifio/blob/scifio-0.24.0/src/main/java/io/scif/formats/BMPFormat.java)
    for a starting point.
