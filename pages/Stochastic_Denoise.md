{% include info-box content=includecontent %} The Stochastic Denoise
plugin implements a current state of the art denoising algorithm. It is
based on random walks through the image along paths of similar pixels,
as proposed by Francisco Estrada et al.
(http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/\~strider/Denoise/). If you intend to use
this plugin in a publication, please cite:

## Settings

The plugin provides two parameters: The noise standard deviation
<b>sigma</b> and the number of <b>samples</b> per pixel.

With the sigma setting, you can adjust the expected amount of noise in
the image. The higher you choose this value, the blurrier the result
will be.

To get more pleasing results, you can increase the number of samples
(i.e., the number of random walks) per pixel. However, this will result
in longer runtime.

Open the image you would like to denoise and start the plugin. Try the
default settings first and click "Denoise". After some seconds, the
denoised image will pop up. You can change the settings and retry - the
denoised image will get updated.
