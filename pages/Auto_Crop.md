This plugin can find the smallest bounding box of an image (or a
rectangular part defined by a selection) by cropping as much background
as possible.

In the version labeled with *(guess background color)*, the plugin tries
to determine the background color by looking at the pixels on the border
of the image, while *Auto Crop* uses the currently selected background
color which can be changed by double-clicking on the pipette symbol or
using the {% include bc content='Image | Color | Color Picker...'%}.

Instead of cropping right away, you can set the selection to the
rectangle that would be cropped to using {% include bc content='Edit |
Selection | Select Bounding Box'%}.
