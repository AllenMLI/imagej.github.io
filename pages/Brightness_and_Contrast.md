**Note:** This page refers to the version of
[ImageJ2](ImageJ2 "wikilink") currently in development. For more
information on using [Fiji](Fiji "wikilink") and [ImageJ
1.x](ImageJ_1.x "wikilink"), please reference the [Fiji
tutorials](:Category:Tutorials "wikilink") and [ImageJ 1.x
documentation](https://imagej.net/docs/).

This tool may be used to adjust the brightness and contrast of an active
image.

## Usage

The Brightness and Contrast tool may be accessed through {% include bc
content='Image | Adjust | Brightness/Contrast'%} or {% include key
content='Ctrl|Shift|C' %}.

"Brightness_Contrast_Window.png")

The upper and lower limits of the display range can be adjusted by
modifying the minimum and maximum settings. Image brightness and image
contrast can be modified by using the brightness and contrast sliders or
by using the arrows on the right of the window to adjust the range.

Selecting 'OK' will make the specified changes to the display and close
the Brightness/Contrast window. All channels in an image will be
simultaneously updated automatically.

ImageJ may provide intelligent thresholding based on the image's
histogram through {% include bc content='Image | Adjust |
Auto-Contrast'%} or {% include key content='Ctrl|Alt|Shift|L' %}.
Repeated usage of this process will allow more pixel values to become
saturated.

## Example

The below images show the effects of adjusting brightness and contrast
settings.
