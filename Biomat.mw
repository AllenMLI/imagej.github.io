== Plugins for 3D image preprocessing. ==
'''Stack Linear Contrast''' - multiplies images in stack by coefficient obtained by linear interpolation of the "first" and "last" coefficient. A simple tool for compensation of contrast decreasing with depth within thick sample.

'''Lipschitz 3D''' Filter - top hat - subtracts slowly varying background calculated as lower Lipschitz envelope from the image.

Preprocessing example: 
[https://imagej.net/_images/2/2e/Capillaries_brain.zip Image of capillaries in brain]
* {{bc | Plugins | Biomat | Stack Linear Contrast}} with parameters (multiplyers) "first"= 1.0 and "last"= 3.0
* {{bc | Process | Filters | Gaussian blur 3D}} with "sigma"= 1 pixel
* {{bc | Plugins | Biomat | Lipschitz 3D Filter}} with parameter "slope"= 2 / pixel

== Plugins for detection of fibres in 3D image. ==
'''Tensor Line 3D Filter''' - enhances white fibers of uniform width sparsely distributed on dark background.

Example: 
[https://imagej.net/_images/e/e8/Capillaries_adipose.zip Image of capillaries in adipose tissue].
* {{bc | Plugins | Biomat | Tensor Line 3D Filter}} with "sigma" set to 3 pixels
* {{bc | Image | Adjust | Brightness/Contrast}}
* {{bc | Process | Filters | Gaussian blur 3D}} with "sigma"= 1 pixel

'''Vector Line 3D Filter''' - enhances white fibers of varying thickness. Crossection of the fibers need not be circular. Parameter "sigma" in pixels corresponds to the largest diameter.

Example: [https://imagej.net/_images/e/e9/Capillaries_heart.zip Image of capillaries in embryonic heart].
* {{bc | Plugins | Biomat | Vector Line 3D Filter}} with parameters "sigma"= 4 pixels, "scale number"= 2
