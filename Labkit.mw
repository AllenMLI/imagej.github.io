Labkit is a FIJI plugin for:
* automatic image segmentation
* labeling regions of an image
The automatic image segmentation functionality is comparable to Trainable Weka Segmenation, but it's better suited for large 3d images. And it has a nice Big Data Viewer based editor.

== Installation ==

Labkit can be installed from the ImageJ update site: http://sites.imagej.net/Labkit/

For details see: [[Following_an_update_site]]

== Start ==

Use ImageJ to open the image you want to create labels for.
In ImageJ, select the image, and from the menu choose Plugins > Segmentation > Labkit.

== Usage ==

=== Basic Navigation ===

* {{key press|Ctrl|Shift|mouse-wheel}} to zoom in and out
* {{key press|right-click|drag}} to move the image
* {{key press|left-click|drag}} to rotate a 3d image
* {{key press|mouse-wheel}} to scroll through the z-slices of a 3d image

=== Create Labels ===

When {{key press|Space}} is pressed, while the mouse is over the image, a circle around the mouse pointer will appear.
* {{key press|Space|left click}} mark the pixels inside the circle
* {{key press|Space|right click}} remove the mark from the pixels inside the circle.
* {{key press|Space|mouse wheel}} change the size of the circle used to mark pixels.

By default pixels can be marked as "foreground" or "background". To switch between these two labels use {{key press|N}}.
