Labkit is a FIJI plugin for:
* automatic image segmentation
* labeling regions of an image
The automatic image segmentation functionality is comparable to Trainable Weka Segmenation, but it's better suited for large 3d images. And it has a nice Big Data Viewer based editor.

== Installation ==

Labkit can be installed from the ImageJ update site: http://sites.imagej.net/Labkit/ (For details on how to install an update site click [[Following_an_update_site|here]].)

To start Labkit in ImageJ, first open the image you want to work with, and then select Plugins > Segmentation > Labkit from the main menu.

== Quick Start ==

Follow these steps to segment an image:
# Open an image in ImageJ.
# Start Labkit by selecting "Plugins > Segmentation > Labkit" from the menu.
# Labkit should start and display the image. If it shows a black window instead of the image: Click {{key press|S}} and adjust the contrast.
# Select "foreground" (In the side bar of Labkit). Select the pencil tool (top bar of Labkit) and draw on the image.
# Select "background" and the pencil tool, and mark some other region of the image as background.
# In the side bar of Labkit, under the heading "Segmentation" you will find an entry "Classifier #1". And next to it there is a play button (black triangle). Click it, to train the Classifier. After a moment you will see the automatic segmentation of your image.
# From Labkit's main menu select "Segmentation -> Show Segmentation Result in ImageJ", to export your segmentation into ImageJ.

== Basic Navigation ==

Labkit is based on Big Data Viewer. Navigation the image works as in Big Data Viewer, and many short cuts work too. Click [[BigDataViewer|here]] for a description of the short cuts.
* {{key press|Ctrl|Shift|mouse-wheel}} to zoom in and out
* {{key press|right-click|drag}} to move the image
* {{key press|left-click|drag}} to rotate a 3d image
* {{key press|mouse-wheel}} to scroll through the z-slices of a 3d image

== Tips & Tricks ==

* If there's a black window, where the image should be? You might need to change the contrast settings: Click on the image, and then press {{key press|S}} on the keyboard. A dialog shows up. Use it to adjust the contrast.
* There can be more than two labels, just click on the "Add label" button...
* Labels can be renamed, by double clicking on them.
* To change the label color, just click on the colored rectangle left of the labels name.
* {{key press|D|mouse-wheel}} to change the size of the brush tool.

== Drawing Tool Shortcuts ==
* {{key press|D|left-click}} to draw with the pencil tool.
* {{key press|E|left-click}} to erase with the pencil tool.
* {{key press|F|left click}} to use the flood fill tool.
* {{key press|R|left-click}} to remove a connected component.
* {{key press|N}} - switch to next label

== Open & Save - Import & Export ==
* Things you can save, open, import or export:
** Labeling - As *.tif or *.labeling
** Bitmap - (One layer of the labeling) As *.tif
** Classifier - As *.classifier, only Labkit is able to work with them.
** Segmentation result - As *.tif, or show to ImageJ
** Segmentation's probability Map - As *.tif, or show in ImageJ
* The word "Labeling" is used to refer to the colorfully displayed areas overlayed on top of the image.
* Labkit's file format for Labelings is *.labeling. It works greate for very large files with very few labels. (This file format is likely to be improved and changed in the future.)
* The labeling can be saved and opened as *.tif as well. (This is a good option for not to big images. And can be used by any other tool.)
