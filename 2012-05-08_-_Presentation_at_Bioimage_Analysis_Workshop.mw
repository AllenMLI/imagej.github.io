On April 30 through May 1 we attended a Bioimage Analysis Workshop in Barcelona entitled "[[ISBI 2012|Bioimage analysis software: is there a future beyond ImageJ?]]" We presented the current status and future directions of [[ImageJ2]].

It was great meeting with developers of related projects, including [[OME]], [[KNIME|KNIME Image Processing]], [[Icy]] and [[BioImageXD]]! The big takeaway message of the workshop was interoperability: we are all striving to make our software work together well, so that users can combine them and benefit from all our efforts.
