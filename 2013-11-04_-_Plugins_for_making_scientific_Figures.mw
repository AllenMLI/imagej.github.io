Writing papers and making figures is and always will be a big part of what scientists do. Many of us use open source software, such as Fiji, to process images however the figure is often finalised in commercial software - typically from Adobe. Needless to say neither Photoshop nor Illustrator are designed to make  scientific figures. 

Two groups have recently introduced plugins that leverage the tools available in ImageJ/Fiji to make scientific figures. Both tools are made by scientists introducing innovative concepts specifically designed to make scientific figure making easier and more controlled.

[http://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/doku.php?id=plugin:utilities:figurej:start '''FigureJ'''] from ''Jerome Mutterer'' and [http://srv-gred.u-clermont1.fr/labmirouse/software/ '''ScientiFig'''] from ''Benoit Aigouy'' are well documented, open source ([https://github.com/mutterer/figurej FigureJ] [https://github.com/baigouy/ScientiFig ScientiFig]) and published:

Mutterer, J. & Zinck, E. (2013) '''Quick-and-clean article figures with FigureJ''' ''Journal of Microscopy'', 252 (1), 1365-2818 doi:10.1111/jmi.12069

Aigouy B. & Mirouse V. (2013) '''ScientiFig: a tool to build publication-ready scientific figures'''
''Nature Methods'', 10, 1048 doi:10.1038/nmeth.2692

Each tool is available in Fiji through its own [[List_of_update_sites|'''Update Site''']].

Finally the OMERO team is also rolling out a Figure making plugin showcased here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anJPPx7uoUM.

Making figures will never be the same.
