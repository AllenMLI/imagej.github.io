This page should be used internally to discuss the new IJ user guide layout. Once polished, it should serve to orient on when converting old user guide sections or preparing new sections to end up with a uniform layout.

The syntax is always shown in the gray boxes and the actual look you will see directly below each syntax specification.

If you want to add other templates, here you can find the ones existing on imagej.net: [http://imagej.net/index.php?title=Special%3AAllPages&from=&to=&namespace=10 Template pages]
