The plugin contains an interface to reconstruct interactively and recursively a cell lineage from a static labeled image.
{{TOC}}
== Guideline ==
====Input ====
TreeJ should be launched on a 2D or 3D labeled image (8 bits, 16 bits or 32 bits). The labeling can be discontinuous and watershed lines, if present, are not a problem. The region labels with zero is considered as the background.
----
==== Tree construction ====
To link two sister cell (in ''Pair cells'' panel):
* click on them on the image, it actualizes the corresponding fields (Label1 and Label2)
* or write label numbers in fields Label1 and Label2
'''Apply''' to validate the pairing

'''Reset''' to put fields in their initial state.


To make a modification (in ''Unpair or tag'' panel): 
* select the erroneous mother cell with click+Ctrl (or Click+pom on MACOS) and 
* or  write the label number in the Label field
Validate with the '''Unpair''' button.
----
==== Tree annotation ====
* if Tag field is filled during linking action, the create mother cell will have the tag
* select the cell (Ctrl+click| pom+click) or enter its label number in the label field of the ''unpair and tag'' panel and enter the tag in the field "Tag"
'''Apply''' to validate the tagging.
----
==== Image output====

* TreeJ doesn't modify the input image to extract the modified shown image : use '''Current view'''
* an image of cells from a '''Substree''' of Root label number
* an image of all cells coming from a mother tagged with the wanted tag

----
==== Tree====
To saved tree information, two possible formats :
* '''.treeV''' home made format, compatible as input of TreeJ. Contain tree and tag information
* '''.nwk''' [[http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/newicktree.html newick tree]], compatible as input of treeJ, but contain only the tree information

The drawing tree can be exportzd to a PDF file (named with the input image name) with the '''Export to PDF''' button.
== Installation ==
Download .jar and put it in "plugin" directory of ImageJ or Fiji directory. Reload ImageJ/Fiji and TreeJ will be accessible in the {{bc | Plugin | TreeJ}} menu.
