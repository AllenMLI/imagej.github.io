VisBio is a biological visualization tool designed for easy visualization and analysis of multidimensional image data, developed by [[User:Rueden|Curtis Rueden]] at [http://loci.wisc.edu/ UW-Madison LOCI].

VisBio is based on the [http://visad.ssec.wisc.edu/ VisAD] Java component library for interactive and collaborative visualization and analysis of numerical data. VisBio was first released in 2002. It was discontinued in 2009 in favor of [[ImageJ2]], with the idea that the VisAD-based visualization components of VisBio could be migrated to the ImageJ platform in the future.
