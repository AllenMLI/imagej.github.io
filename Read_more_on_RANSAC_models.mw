Ransac models used in the MTrack include the line and polynomial models to perform the determination of inliers. SInce the underlying process of Microtubule dynamics is a random walk process, in order to determine the inliers it is essential to choose a polynomial to determine the inliers from the length versus time plots. The user has the option of choosing either a second order or a third order polynomial regularized with a linear function. 

The regularization parameter determines how much linearity is present in the polynomial function used for the fitting.


* Polynomial model y = ax^3


* Line model
