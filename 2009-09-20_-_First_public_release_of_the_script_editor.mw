This is a first ''alpha'' release of the [[SoC_2009_Ideas#Add_a_simple_yet_minimally_powerful_plugin_and_script_editor|script editor]] that was one of our [[2009-04-20_-_Summer_of_Code:_We_got_us_three_students|Google Summer of Code]] projects.

While it was pretty well stress-tested in the [[2009-08-04_-_Fiji_School_-_Last_Call_for_Student_Applications|Fiji School]], and while it works pretty well for some of the Fiji developers, it is more like a technology preview.

Having said all that, if you are interested in scripting Fiji, just use the [[Update Fiji|Fiji Updater]] and [[Using the Script Editor|give it a shot]]!

Speaking of shots: here is a screenshot:
