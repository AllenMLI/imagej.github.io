Tobias and Saalfeld found it a great idea to create this discussion page that, if ever possible, will be filled with the daily conceptual discussions and results.  That way, all interested people can contribute and keep track on what we're trying to tackle next.

We discussed the View concept: Summary is that View<T> would be an interface that can return its target T, the data it is generated from.  A View is an [...]Accessible that provides transformed or not transformed access to this target data.  Since we could not see any reasonable application for the bare View interface, we will not implement it but use it in informal speech about virtualized access.  Examples are IterableIntervalSubset, arbitrary Neighborhoods, RandomAccessView, RealRandomAccessView, TransformView, RealTransfomView, StructuredElement, HyperShpere, SuperInterval...
