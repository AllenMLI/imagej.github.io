There's a new experimental, modernized BoneJ available through the ImageJ [http://imagej.net/Updater updater]. It's update site is called [http://sites.imagej.net/BoneJ BoneJ experimental].

This version works with the latest Fiji, and complies with the modern ImageJ [[architecture]]. Most plug-ins also now support hyperstacks, i.e. images with multiple channels or time frames.

As the code is still experimental, it's still likely to change a lot. This means any scripts using the code might break, results can change, and plug-ins gain and lose parameters. Tools marked with ''WIP'' (work in progress), are more likely to undergo large changes.
