== I have a problem that is not covered on this page! ==

If you have an issue that is not mentioned here, you might want to [[Help:Contents|ask on one of the mailing lists, or via IRC, or enter a bug report]].

= Updating =

== I updated Fiji via ''Help>Update Fiji'', and now it does not start anymore! ==

If you are on MacOSX, most likely you did not update in some time, and you were bitten by a bug in the updater that is already fixed (but you did not get the fix in time). Please follow [[Fix non-functional Fiji after Update on MacOSX|these instructions]].

== The Updater always says ''Connection refused''. Maybe it does not use the proxy? ==

Indeed, an earlier version of the Updater does not use your system-wide network proxy settings. This is fixed in the meantime, but you need to update the updater using [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/downloads/Heidelberg/Update_Fiji_Using_Proxy.bsh this script] (just download it and open it in Fiji).

Alternatively, you can update the updater manually like this:

* open the [[Script Editor]] with ''File>New>Script''
* set the language to ''Beanshell'' in the ''Language'' menu of the editor
* paste the following code (and adjust it to match your settings):
<source lang="java">
import ij.IJ;

System.setProperty("java.net.useSystemProxies", "true");
IJ.run("Update Fiji");
</source>
* run the script via the ''Run'' menu

= [[3D Viewer]] =

== The 3D Viewer opens a window saying ''An unexpected exception occurred.'' ==

If in the same window, it also says:

 java.lang.NullPointerException:Canvas3D: null GraphicsConfiguration

the reason is most likely that your graphics setup does not have any hardware 3D acceleration. This can happen e.g. when you run Fiji via a remote X11 connection (3D acceleration works only when the graphics are displayed on the same machine as the program runs).

Unfortunately, there is not workaround/fix for this situation yet, except to use Fiji locally when you want to use the 3D Viewer.

= Development =

== How can I build Fiji myself? ==

[[Downloading and Building Fiji From Source|Download and build it]]. You need Git for that (if you are on Windows, please use [http://msysgit.googlecode.com Git for Windows]).

== I cloned fiji.git, but have a compile error regarding a class ''Appearance''. ==

If you get an error similar to this:

 Building plugins/VIB_.jar <- src-plugins/VIB_/Align_Image.java src...
 Building plugins/3D_Viewer.jar <- src-plugins/3D_Viewer/ImageJ_3D_...
 src-plugins/3D_Viewer/customnode/CustomLineMesh.java:6: cannot find symbol
 symbol  : class Appearance
 location: package javax.media.j3d
 import javax.media.j3d.Appearance;
                       ^

it means that you do not have ''Java3D'' installed. This happens typically when you have an environment variable ''JAVA_HOME'' set to an existing JDK <u>without</u> ''Java3D''. To force the Fiji Build system to clone Fiji's known-good JDK, call

 unset JAVA_HOME

Alternatively, if you have write permissions to the path ''JAVA_HOME'' points to, you could install ''Java3D'' manually.

== I tried to build Fiji, but get ''Target misc/headless.jar was not built!'' ==

You need to update the ImageJA submodule:

 git submodule update ImageJA
