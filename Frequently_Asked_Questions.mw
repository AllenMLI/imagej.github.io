= Input/Output =

== The image I loaded is displayed all black! But it is not black! ==

This problem usually arises when 12-bit or 14-bit images are loaded into Fiji without autoscaling. In that case, they are treated as if they were 16-bit images, and therefore the dynamic range is all wrong. You can fix this by clicking on ''Image>Adjust>Brightness/Contrast...'' and hitting the ''Auto'' button.

= Installing/Updating =

== How do I install Fiji? ==

The installation of Fiji is described on specific pages for [[Install_Fiji_on_MacOSX|MacOSX]], [[Install_Fiji_on_Windows|Windows]] and [[Install_Fiji_on_Linux|Linux]].

== How do I install additional plugins? ==

You can drag 'n drop the .jar files onto the Fiji window, or use ''Plugins>Install Plugin...'' with .jar, .class and .java files, or copy the plugins to ''Fiji.app/plugins/'' and call ''Help>Refresh Menus'' manually. A walk-through with screenshots is available [[Installing 3rd party plugins|here]].

== My plugin runs fine in the [[Script Editor]], but it does not show up in the menus when I install it. What's wrong? ==

To be picked up as a plugin, the ''.jar'''s file name must contain an underscore, and it either needs to contain an appropriate ''plugins.config'' file or the class name needs to contain an underscore, too.

The safest way to ensure these conventions is to use the ''File>Export as .jar file'' menu item.

== I updated Fiji via ''Help>Update Fiji'', and now it does not start anymore! ==

If you are on MacOSX, most likely you did not update in some time, and you were bitten by a bug in the updater that is already fixed (but you did not get the fix in time). Please follow [[Fix non-functional Fiji after Update on MacOSX|these instructions]].

== The Updater always says ''Connection refused''. Maybe it does not use the proxy? ==

Indeed, an earlier version of the Updater does not use your system-wide network proxy settings. This is fixed in the meantime, but you need to update the updater using [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/downloads/Heidelberg/Update_Fiji_Using_Proxy.bsh this script] (just download it and open it in Fiji).

Alternatively, you can update the updater manually like this:

* open the [[Script Editor]] with ''File>New>Script''
* set the language to ''Beanshell'' in the ''Language'' menu of the editor
* paste the following code (and adjust it to match your settings):
<source lang="java">
import ij.IJ;

System.setProperty("java.net.useSystemProxies", "true");
IJ.run("Update Fiji");
</source>
* run the script via the ''Run'' menu

== I updated to Ubuntu 11.04 and now I no longer see the Title bar when I close Fiji ==

I can no longer move any windows or use the X button on the title bar to close 
them (the window decorations all disappear).

If you are really on Ubuntu 11.04, an update should fix the problem. If you are not on Ubuntu 11.04, or if the update does not fix the problem, please read on for possible workarounds.

This is not a Fiji problem but a bug in the NVIDIA driver.
One solution is described in:
http://www.pendrivelinux.com/ubuntu-desktop-effects-fixing-the-missing-titlebar/

Edit (as root) the file /etc/X11/xorg.conf and add the following 2 options in '''Section "Device"''' before the '''EndSection''' line:
   Option "AddARGBVisuals" "True"
   Option "AddARGBGLXVisuals" "True"

The above eases the problem but does not completely solve it. The solution will be an updated driver from NVIDIA when it is available. If you choose to remain with Unity or Ubuntu Classic, you may log out and then log in again when the problem appears. You can also restart the window manager without logging out by running
   compiz --replace &

in a terminal. This restores the window decorations but all windows from all virtual desktops end in the first one.

Another solution is to install Unity-2D and choose it when you log in. This seems to work well. It also solves a number of general display problems.

= [[3D Viewer]] =

== The 3D Viewer opens a window saying ''An unexpected exception occurred.'' ==

If in the same window, it also says:

 java.lang.NullPointerException:Canvas3D: null GraphicsConfiguration

the reason is most likely that your graphics setup does not have any hardware 3D acceleration. This can happen e.g. when you run Fiji via a remote X11 connection (3D acceleration works only when the graphics are displayed on the same machine as the program runs).

Unfortunately, there is not workaround/fix for this situation yet, except to use Fiji locally when you want to use the 3D Viewer.

== Problem with Intel graphics cards ==

There is a known problem with older Windows drivers for some Intel graphics cards. Usually, this is fixed by installing new drivers. If you would like to help make Fiji nicer by detecting faulty driver versions, please [[Help:Contents#Getting_help_regarding_Fiji|contact us]].

== The 3D Viewer simply crashes ==

Unfortunately, there are quite a large number of possible reasons. Please help us by [[Debugging_intro#Debugging_Java3D_issues|debugging the issues]] and [[Help:Contents|contacting us]] (mailing list or IRC) with the information. You can also [[report a Bug]], which will provide a lot of addidtional, potentially useful information.

== Only a gray rectangle is shown by the 3D Viewer ==

As with 3D Viewer crashes, there are quite a large number of possible reasons. Please help us by [[Debugging_intro#Debugging_Java3D_issues|debugging the issues]] and [[Help:Contents|contacting us]] (preferably via mailing list) with the information. You can also [[report a Bug]], which will provide a lot of addidtional, potentially useful information.

= Development =

== How can I build Fiji myself? ==

[[Downloading and Building Fiji From Source|Download and build it]]. You need Git for that (if you are on Windows, please use [http://msysgit.googlecode.com Git for Windows]).

== I cloned fiji.git, but have a compile error regarding a class ''Appearance''. ==

If you get an error similar to this:

 Building plugins/VIB_.jar <- src-plugins/VIB_/Align_Image.java src...
 Building plugins/3D_Viewer.jar <- src-plugins/3D_Viewer/ImageJ_3D_...
 src-plugins/3D_Viewer/customnode/CustomLineMesh.java:6: cannot find symbol
 symbol  : class Appearance
 location: package javax.media.j3d
 import javax.media.j3d.Appearance;
                       ^

it means that you do not have ''Java3D'' installed. This happens typically when you have an environment variable ''JAVA_HOME'' set to an existing JDK <u>without</u> ''Java3D''. To force the Fiji Build system to clone Fiji's known-good JDK, call

 unset JAVA_HOME

Alternatively, if you have write permissions to the path ''JAVA_HOME'' points to, you could install ''Java3D'' manually.

== I tried to build Fiji, but get ''Target misc/headless.jar was not built!'' ==

You need to update the ImageJA submodule:

 git submodule update ImageJA

= Miscellaneous =

== Why do you program in Java? Is C++ not much faster? ==

While it used to be true that Java is always slower than the equivalent in C++, this is no longer true. [http://paulbuchheit.blogspot.com/2007/06/java-is-faster-than-c.html There] have [http://www.azulsystems.com/blog/cliff/2009-09-06-java-vs-c-performanceagain been] quite [http://vanillajava.blogspot.com/2011/08/java-can-be-significantly-faster-than-c.html a few benchmarks] comparing Java vs C++ performance, [http://keithlea.com/javabench/ this one] probably being the grandfather of all.

Pragmatically, one should note that there is not really a big difference in performance when comparing Java to C++.

The real reason why Fiji is written in Java is that ImageJ is written in Java.

The reason why we chose ImageJ as the core of Fiji is that it runs without trouble and without recompiling on the major platforms: Windows, MacOSX and Linux. And plugins compiled on one platform also execute on all other platforms without recompiling. And profiling and debugging is easier with Java than with C++. And all programs/plugins double as libraries.

So the true reason why we use Java is probably: it makes Fiji accessible.

== What is this ''headless'' mode and what do I need it for? ==

The term ''headless'' refers to running Fiji without a graphical desktop, e.g. on a cluster.

For technical reasons, GUI elements such as a menu or a button cannot be used when running Java on Linux in headless mode. That is the reason why we put custom classes into a file called ''headless.jar'' which override specific ImageJ classes that would try to instantiate GUI elements. In headless mode, that ''.jar'' file is inserted into the Java class path. In non-headless mode, the ''.jar'' file is not inserted into the class path (that is the reason why ''headless.jar'' is not in the ''jars/'' subdirectory).
