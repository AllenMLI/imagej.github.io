= Input/Output =

== The image I loaded is displayed all black! But it is not black! ==

This problem usually arises when 12-bit or 14-bit images are loaded into Fiji without autoscaling. In that case, they are treated as if they were 16-bit images, and therefore the dynamic range is all wrong. You can fix this by clicking on ''Image>Adjust>Brightness/Contrast...'' and hitting the ''Auto'' button.

= Installing/Updating =

== How do I install Fiji? ==

The installation of Fiji is described on specific pages for [[Install_Fiji_on_MacOSX|MacOSX]], [[Install_Fiji_on_Windows|Windows]] and [[Install_Fiji_on_Linux|Linux]].

== How do I install additional plugins? ==

You can drag 'n drop the .jar files onto the Fiji window, or use ''Plugins>Install Plugin...'' with .jar, .class and .java files, or copy the plugins to ''Fiji.app/plugins/'' and call ''Help>Refresh Menus'' manually. A walk-through with screenshots is available [[Installing 3rd party plugins|here]].

== I updated Fiji via ''Help>Update Fiji'', and now it does not start anymore! ==

If you are on MacOSX, most likely you did not update in some time, and you were bitten by a bug in the updater that is already fixed (but you did not get the fix in time). Please follow [[Fix non-functional Fiji after Update on MacOSX|these instructions]].

== The Updater always says ''Connection refused''. Maybe it does not use the proxy? ==

Indeed, an earlier version of the Updater does not use your system-wide network proxy settings. This is fixed in the meantime, but you need to update the updater using [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/downloads/Heidelberg/Update_Fiji_Using_Proxy.bsh this script] (just download it and open it in Fiji).

Alternatively, you can update the updater manually like this:

* open the [[Script Editor]] with ''File>New>Script''
* set the language to ''Beanshell'' in the ''Language'' menu of the editor
* paste the following code (and adjust it to match your settings):
<source lang="java">
import ij.IJ;

System.setProperty("java.net.useSystemProxies", "true");
IJ.run("Update Fiji");
</source>
* run the script via the ''Run'' menu

= [[3D Viewer]] =

== The 3D Viewer opens a window saying ''An unexpected exception occurred.'' ==

If in the same window, it also says:

 java.lang.NullPointerException:Canvas3D: null GraphicsConfiguration

the reason is most likely that your graphics setup does not have any hardware 3D acceleration. This can happen e.g. when you run Fiji via a remote X11 connection (3D acceleration works only when the graphics are displayed on the same machine as the program runs).

Unfortunately, there is not workaround/fix for this situation yet, except to use Fiji locally when you want to use the 3D Viewer.

== Problem with Intel graphics cards ==

There is a known problem with older Windows drivers for some Intel graphics cards. Usually, this is fixed by installing new drivers. If you would like to help make Fiji nicer by detecting faulty driver versions, please [[Help:Contents#Getting_help_regarding_Fiji|contact us]].

= Development =

== How can I build Fiji myself? ==

[[Downloading and Building Fiji From Source|Download and build it]]. You need Git for that (if you are on Windows, please use [http://msysgit.googlecode.com Git for Windows]).

== I cloned fiji.git, but have a compile error regarding a class ''Appearance''. ==

If you get an error similar to this:

 Building plugins/VIB_.jar <- src-plugins/VIB_/Align_Image.java src...
 Building plugins/3D_Viewer.jar <- src-plugins/3D_Viewer/ImageJ_3D_...
 src-plugins/3D_Viewer/customnode/CustomLineMesh.java:6: cannot find symbol
 symbol  : class Appearance
 location: package javax.media.j3d
 import javax.media.j3d.Appearance;
                       ^

it means that you do not have ''Java3D'' installed. This happens typically when you have an environment variable ''JAVA_HOME'' set to an existing JDK <u>without</u> ''Java3D''. To force the Fiji Build system to clone Fiji's known-good JDK, call

 unset JAVA_HOME

Alternatively, if you have write permissions to the path ''JAVA_HOME'' points to, you could install ''Java3D'' manually.

== I tried to build Fiji, but get ''Target misc/headless.jar was not built!'' ==

You need to update the ImageJA submodule:

 git submodule update ImageJA
