Access it via ''File > Make Screencast''.

= Tips for a good screencast =

* A screencast's primary purpose is to cast the screen. So: make sure that something moves on the screen every once in a while, rather than presenting a boring static screen while rambling on.
* Take your time. There is no need to click so fast that nobody can follow.
* Use the mouse. If you use keyboard shortcuts, be sure to tell the user, preferably by pointing to a menu item whose label mentions the shortcut. Remember: you want to teach others, not to show off how clever you are.
* Make an outline As with any good presentation, you want to tell a story. Take the audience from where they are right now, motivate them (e.g. by showing a nice image to process), explain the steps, show the end result. Maybe end on a funny note.
* What makes a good screencast excellent is a good verbal explanation. It is okay to explain slowly, with lots of breaks, but it needs to give the whole presentation a shape and a direction.

The crucial -- and most difficult part -- is without doubt the verbal explanation. To that end, it is most helpful to imagine a real person to direct your explanation to. It cannot hurt to practice what you want to say without recording it right away.
