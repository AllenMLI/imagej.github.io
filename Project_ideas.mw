This page contains a loose list of ideas for cool/useful projects that have some relation to Fiji

== Plugin for Mixed-File-Format MultiVirtualHyperStack viewing window ==

The idea is to be able to display multiple virtual hyperstack-type data sets in a single multi-color composite window. I've already arranged this using multiple QuickTime Movies or AVIs. But the ideal will be to allow overlay from mixed data of any of the many BioFormats-supported file types.

The user would be able to overlay, realign and fit the separate channels in 4 dimensions, and then synchronously browse the composite view in ZT dimensions. There should be some demand for this functionality, especially with the very large data repositories being made by many labs in different file formats. Enabling automatic spatial calibration from metadata would allow measurements analysis of all channels with regions of interest addressing all of the overlaid data.

The project would consist of

* Writing a class extending VirtualStack.java class for each type of input data file series.  Currently, these exist for FileSeriesFromList and QTVirtualStack.

* Create a MultiVirtualHyperStack.java class that can organize multiple VirtualStack types into a single VirtualHyperStack displayed via a single ImagePlus and StackWindow.  The getProcessor() method in this class must be able to sort out the file coordinates of any channel/slice/frame requested from the mixed-format virtual stack and call getProcessor() from each of the specialized VirtualStack classes for each format.

* Create a control panel that allows adjustments of XYZT position for any single VirtualHyperStack that is a component of the mixed overlay window.

= Suggestions by Gabriel Landini =

== Alpha_shapes / concave_hull / Graph Theory constructs (in addition to the Delaunay/Voronoi) ==

== Colorizing algorithms (i.e greyscale to colour,there are several methods) ==

== Retinex algorithm ==

== Interactively adjustable intensity/LUT curves (not just linear controls, but splines/etc based) ==

== Support for storing ROIs in TIFF tag fields, so ROIs can be saved with the images) ==

== Integrate ImageFlow into Fiji ==

[[Image:ImageFlow.png|700px|center]]

ImageFlow provides a graphical way to construct macros.  Every action is represented by a node which the user can connect with lines to define a workflow.

ImageFlow has its own [http://github.com/Dahie/imageflow Git repository] ([http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=imageflow.git;a=summary our mirror).

The following issues need to be resolved:

* At the moment, it is not a true plugin, but wants to start its own ImageJ instance

* it only targets the macro language, while we want to target all the scripting languages supported by Fiji

* it searches for its .xml files outside of the .jar file, which makes it cumbersome to ship with the Fiji updater.

== Object (rather than image) selector/sorter (something like Kai's pixolu.de) ==

If you haven't tried it, you should) to create "objects like these" filters/classifiers to be extracted from images and sets of images.

== Interface between R and ImageJ/Fiji ==

Dimiter Prodanov has done something like this, but it would be nice to have a set of implemented procedures so IJ/Fiji can run statistical procedures directly from Results tables, etc).

== A set of more powerful painting brushes and image editing tools ==

== Cross platform webcam support (to produce cheap videomicroscope/telescope units) ==

== Fractal interpolation resizing (from the GIMP GSoC entry) ==

== A unique/common segmentation interface ==

I have collected near 15 new histogram segmentation methods that would be better put under a single interface together with others already available.

== A javascript Recorder ==

Similar to the Macro Recorder but producing javascript instead.

== Virtual microscope-like image viewer ==
                                                                                
== HSB/Lab painting modes ==

There is a wish list on the [http://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/doku.php?id=wishlist:start&s%5b%5d=ideas ImageJ Documentation Wiki].
