== Plugin for Mixed-File-Format MultiVirtualHyperStack viewing window ==

The idea is to be able to display multiple virtual hyperstack-type data sets in a single multi-color composite window. I've already arranged this using multiple QuickTime Movies or AVIs. But the ideal will be to allow overlay from mixed data of any of the many BioFormats-supported file types.

The user would be able to overlay, realign and fit the separate channels in 4 dimensions, and then synchronously browse the composite view in ZT dimensions. There should be some demand for this functionality, especially with the very large data repositories being made by many labs in different file formats. Enabling automatic spatial calibration from metadata would allow measurements analysis of all channels with regions of interest addressing all of the overlaid data.

The project would consist of

* Writing a class extending VirtualStack.java class for each type of input data file series.  Currently, these exist for FileSeriesFromList and QTVirtualStack.

* Create a MultiVirtualHyperStack.java class that can organize multiple VirtualStack types into a single VirtualHyperStack displayed via a single ImagePlus and StackWindow.  The getProcessor() method in this class must be able to sort out the file coordinates of any channel/slice/frame requested from the mixed-format virtual stack and call getProcessor() from each of the specialized VirtualStack classes for each format.

* Create a control panel that allows adjustments of XYZT position for any single VirtualHyperStack that is a component of the mixed overlay window.

== Interactively adjustable intensity/LUT curves ==

In Fiji, you can adjust the dynamic range of an image by calling ''Image>Adjust>Brightness & Contrast''.  However, this only lets you choose a linear mapping between pixel intensity and lookup table.  This project aims to provide non-linear controls, such as piecewise linear functions, gamma curves, splines, etc

= Image processing plugins =

== Implementing algorithms for imglib ==

The new imglib supports dimension-, storage- and data type independent image processing. This library has some algorithms built-in already but there is a strong need to generically implement more general image processing algorithms, storage strategies and data types such as:

* Interpolation (Cubic, Sinc, Spline, ...)
* Histograms
* Entropy Filter, Average Filter, Percentile(Min, Median, Max) Filter, ...
* Memory Management for partial image loading
* Color Spaces and Color Space Conversions
* Generic Import/Export

== Colorizing algorithms ==

There are a number of publications about turning greyscale images into color images.  This project is about implementing as many of them as possible.

Note: this is an ill-posed problem, as there is not enough information in the greyscale images to identify the original color.  However, under certain circumstances, it is possible to estimate a best guess for the color for most or all pixels.

== Retinex algorithm ==

The retinex theory models the retina to estimate color disregarding illumination, i.e. it provides algorithms to correct for irregular illumination of same-colored objects.

== Image selector/sorter ==

Implement an algorithm that sorts a number of images by features, such as color.  Inspired by Kai-Uwe Barthel's [http://pixolu.de pixolu] project.

== A set of more powerful painting brushes and image editing tools ==

Even if Fiji aims at scientific image processing rather than beautifying photographs, it might be fun to take your holiday pictures and post-process them with the image processing software you are familiar with.

Possible tools to do so would be airbrushes (allowing for transparent colors) or brushes with a certain inertia to allow calligraphic effects, etc

= Scripting =

== Add JMathLib (Matlab clone) support ==

Quite a few algorithms are available as proof-of-concept Matlab scripts.  While it is [ftp://ftp.alvyray.com/Acrobat/6_Pixel.pdf wrong to think of pixels as little squares], and literally all Matlab scripts to perform image processing are suffering from that shortcoming, it would be very nice nevertheless to be able to run the scripts without having to buy Matlab licenses just for that purpose.

Happily, there is a Matlab clone written in Java: [http://www.jmathlib.de/ JMathLib].  While it is apparently not a speed demon, it should be useful to add JMathLib as a new scripting language to ImageJ, and integrate it into Fiji so that Matlab scripts can be executed just like all other ImageJ scripts, too.

The project would consist of

* getting as many .m scripts for image processing as possible,

* integrating JMathLib as a script language into Fiji (using the infrastructure shared by Jython, JRuby, Clojure, Javascript and BeanShell) -- I suggest having a look at [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=fiji.git;a=blob;f=src-plugins/JRuby/JRuby_Interpreter.java the JRuby Interpreter] for an example,

* adapting (or overriding) JMathLib's image toolbox so that it integrates seamlessly with ImageJ,

* test (and fix what does not work) as many .m scripts as possible.

== A Javascript Recorder ==

Similar to the Macro Recorder but producing Javascript instead.  There is a Javascript recorder in ImageJ right now, but it is in no way integrated into the Fiji Script Editor.  It also appears that the Javascript recorder is not as robust as the Macro recorder yet.

== Code templates in the Script Editor ==

The Script Editor provides a fine way to script small plugins that do some simple tasks.  If you know how.

Better to start from a nice template, say, iterating over all pixels in the current image, or over all images in a user-specified directory.  To make adding new templates easy, they should be simple text files in ''Script_Editor.jar'' (the path describing where they should go in the menu).

The goal of this project is to provide a few templates (categorized by language) for common tasks.

== Adding a ''Make Jar'' command the Script Editor ==

When writing plugins, the goal is often to provide the result to some users in the end.  ImageJA already has the ''Plugins>Install Plugin...'' command, but that requires a ''.class'', ''.jar'' or a script file.  The easiest way to handle plugins is as a single ''.jar'' file which can be sent via email.

Add a ''Make Jar'' command and a new menu to the Script Editor, and maybe a "Make Jar with Source" command, too.

== Make Script Editor rename a Java class automatically on ''Save As...'' ==

A public Java class must be compiled from a source file reflecting the class name, so it makes sense to rename the Java class when the file is saved under a new name.  Teach the Script Editor to do that.

== Use the Script Editor code base for ''File>New>Fiji  Tutorial'' ==

The venerable AWT dialog displays problems with certain X11 drivers.  Therefore, let's use the Script Editor code base instead.

In the same run, move the menu items to a more developer-specific submenu, say, ''File>New>Fiji Development>Fiji Tutorial''.

While at it, add ''Fiji News'' and ''Fiji Snapshot'' options, as they also need to upload to the Wiki.

== Fix Script Editor's ''Search'' functionality ==

It is nice that the Search remembers the latest search term, but it forgets the default button.

Further, when the search wraps around, the current cursor position is lost.  Fix that.

== Add a ''Bookmark'' function to the Script Editor ==

Often, it would be very convenient to remember the current cursor position to come back to, after looking around in other parts of the file.  Maybe Ctrl+B (together with a menu entry), or Ctrl+<digit> are good ways to implement the user interface.  (The code should be similar to the ''Goto Line...'' function.

== Add tabbed editing to the Script Editor ==

For ease of implementation, the current version of the script editor only supports editing one file at a time (the Summer of Code seems to have been too remove that limitation).  One possibility is to allow tabbed editing, another is to connect all Script Editor instances so that they know what is opened where (this would also help in the case the user is editing the same file <u>twice</u>, which is not handled gracefully at the moment).

== Add a function ''Remove unused imports'' to the Script Editor ==

The Script Editor knows a bit about the syntax of the edited file, thanks to RSyntaxTextArea.  So it should be quite possible to add a few functions exploiting that knowledge, e.g. to make wildcard imports explicit, or to remove unused imports.

== Script Editor: Show backtraces in the status window and make them clickable ==

When there is a compiler error, or an exception at runtime, it would be better to show the backtrace in the Script Editor window.  Further, it would be very convenient to jump to the appropriate code line when clicking on a line of the backtrace (this most likely depends on [[#Add_tabbed_editing_to_the_Script_Editor|tabbed editing]]).

= Fiji development environment =

== GUI Testing framework ==

We have some rudimentary GUI testing in the ''tests'' branch but it may be better to use an established GUI framework such as [https://jemmy.dev.java.net/ Jemmy] or [http://www.marathontesting.com/Marathon.html Marathon].

The idea is, in any case, to record mouse moves and keyboard presses, optionally waiting for some GUI element (such as a window) to appear, and error out if something unexpected happens -- which most likely means that something broke and needs fixing.

== Interface between R and ImageJ/Fiji ==

Dimiter Prodanov has done something like this, but it would be nice to have a set of implemented procedures so IJ/Fiji can run statistical procedures directly from Results tables, etc).

= User interface improvements =

== Integrate ImageFlow into Fiji ==

[[Image:ImageFlow.png|700px|center]]

ImageFlow provides a graphical way to construct macros.  Every action is represented by a node which the user can connect with lines to define a workflow.

ImageFlow has its own [http://github.com/Dahie/imageflow Git repository] ([http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=imageflow.git;a=summary our mirror]).

The following issues need to be resolved:

* At the moment, it is not a true plugin, but wants to start its own ImageJ instance

* it only targets the macro language, while we want to target all the scripting languages supported by Fiji

* it searches for its .xml files outside of the .jar file, which makes it cumbersome to ship with the Fiji updater.

== Provide ''Help on menu item'' ==

Many commands available from menu items are actually plugins, so they are documented nicely on the Fiji Wiki.  There is a beginning of a plugin that changes the cursor to an arrow with a question mark, and (temporarily) the way the menu items are handled: instead of running the corresponding command, the corresponding documentation on the Fiji Wiki is opened in a web browser.

The code needs to be improved, though, to handle special menu items correctly, such as the recent files or the windows menu.

Some menu items are actually provided by the core of ImageJ, and it may be the best to open the appropriate place on the ImageJ website instead of the Fiji Wiki.  In the alternative, the ImageJ documentation should be replicated on the Fiji Wiki under the appropriate page titles.

The user should also be informed that hitting the Esc key gets her out of this mode.

And finally, the Fiji Wiki needs some love to reflect the exact titles of the menu items, most probably by adding appropriate redirects.

== Add a clever ''Save As'' plugin ==

For now, ''File>Save As'' always saves the result as a ''.tiff'' file, even if the user specified a file name ending in, say, ''.png''.

Stephan Preibisch suggests: Add a plugin that determines from a set of extensions which plugin to call to the respective writer plugin.

For extra brownie points, do not hardcode the extension/plugin mapping (like HandleExtraFileTypes), but make it configurable via one or more file.

= Miscellaneous =

== Alpha shapes / concave hull / other Graph Theory algorithms ==

Fiji already contains a [[Delaunay_Voronoi]] plugin.  The purpose of this project is to implement more graph algorithms.  Most likely, this will involve designing a common framework for graph theory as applied to two- or higher-dimensional graphs.

== Support for storing ROIs in TIFF tag fields ==

Fiji can save images as TIFF files and ROIs into custom .roi files.  Provide a way to store the ROIs inside custom tags in the TIFF file so ROIs and images can be saved together.

== Cross platform webcam support ==

Supporting image recording from webcams might provide a cheap way to make videomicroscope/telescope units (possibly using the [[Distortion Correction]] plugin to overcome low-quality CCD chips and lenses).

One way to achieve that would be by using the [http://fmj-sf.net/ Free Java Media Framework].

== A unique/common segmentation interface ==

I have collected near 15 new histogram segmentation methods that would be better put under a single interface together with others already available.

Note: this is more or less implemented in the Auto_Threshold and Auto_Local_Threshold plugins.--[[User:Landini|Gabriel]] 14:47, 29 November 2009 (CET)

== Virtual microscope-like image viewer ==
                                                                                
== HSB/Lab painting modes ==

== Integrate Micro-Manager into Fiji ==

This project requires a bit of knowledge in compiling C++ code on Linux, MacOSX and Windows.  The idea is to make a recipe that other people can use to compile new releases of [http://www.micro-manager.org/ Micro-Manager], as well as integrate it into the Fiji project for a smooth user experience.  To ensure that support for Micro-Manager is not broken inadvertently, you shall add regression tests, too.
