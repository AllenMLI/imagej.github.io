== Overview ==
SNT is ImageJ's framework for semi-automated tracing, visualization, quantitative analyses and modeling of neuronal morphology. For tracing, SNT supports modern multi-dimensional microscopy data, and highly-customizable routines. For data analysis, SNT features advanced visualization tools, access to all major morphology databases, and support for whole-brain circuitry data. It supersedes the original [[SNT:_FAQ#snt|Simple Neurite Tracer]] plug-in.

SNT's documentation is extensive. Please use the navigation bar on too of the page to access the different sections. The major sections are organized as follows:
* '''[[SNT:_Manual|Manual]]''': SNT's user guide for tracing operations
* '''[[SNT:_Step-By-Step_Instructions|Walk-throughs]]''': Detailed step-by-step instructions for specific tasks
* '''[[SNT:_Screencasts|Screencasts]]''': Video tutorials. If you are using SNT for the first time you probably want to start here
* '''[[SNT:_Reconstruction_Viewer|Reconstruction Viewer]]''': SNT's entry point for visualization of pre-existing data. If you are analyzing reconstructions you may want to start here.
* '''[[SNT:_Analysis|Analysis]]''' Overview of all analysis commands, accessible in either the tracing interface or [[SNT:_Reconstruction_Viewer|Reconstruction Viewer]]
* '''[[SNT:_Scripting|Scripting]]''' Details on how to use SNT as a scripting library

[[Image:SimpleNeuriteTracer2.png|thumb|center|800px|SNT Overview. A key feature of SNT is that ''every'' aspect of the program can be [[SNT:_Scripting|scripted]] in any of Fiji's supported languages, or from Python through [https://github.com/imagej/pyimagej pyimagej]. ]]

==Features==

===Tracing===
* Support for up to 5D multidimensional images (including multichannel, and those with a time axis). While tracing, visibility of non-traced channels can be toggled at will
* Precise placement of nodes is aided by a local search that automatically snaps the cursor to neurites wihin a 3D neighborhood
* A-star search can be performed on a second, non-displayed image. This allows for e.g., tracing on a pre-process (filtered) image while interacting with the unfiltered image (or vice-versa). If enough RAM is available toggling between the two data sources is immediate
* Tracing is scriptable and can be interleaved with image processing routines
* Paths can be tagged, searched, grouped and filtered by morphometric properties (length, radius, etc.)
* Paths can be edited, i.e., a path can be merged into a existing one, or split into two. Nodes can be moved, deleted, or inserted
* Post-hoc refinement of node positioning by 'snapping' traces to the fluorescent signal associated with a a path

=== Analysis ===
* ''Extensive'' repertoire of metrics, namely those provided by [http://cng.gmu.edu:8080/Lm/help/index.htm L-measure] and [https://github.com/BlueBrain/NeuroM NeuroM]. Metrics can be collected from groups of cells, single cells, or parts thereof
* Analysis based on neuropil annotations for whole-brain data such as [https://ml-neuronbrowser.janelia.org/ MouseLight]
* Direct access to public databases, including [https://ml-neuronbrowser.janelia.org/ MouseLight], [http://www.flycircuit.tw FlyCircuit] and [http://neuromorpho.org/ NeuroMorpho]
* Built-in commands for ''immediate'' retrieval of summary statistics, comparison plots and histograms
* Image processing: Reconstructions can be skeletonized, converted to masks or ROIs, and voxel intensities profiled
* Sholl and Horton-Strahler analyses. Graph theory-based and Persistent homology-based analyses
* Modeling: access to the [[SNT:_Modeling|Cx3D simulation engine]]

=== Visualization ===
* [[SNT:_Reconstruction_Viewer|Reconstruction Viewer]]: Standalone hardware-accelerated 3D visualization tool for both meshes and reconstructions.
** Interactive and programmatic scenes (controlled rotations, panning, zoom, scaling, animation, “dark/light mode”, etc.)
** Customizable views: Interactive management of scene elements, controls for transparency, color interpolation, lightning, path smoothing, etc.. Ability to render both local and remote files on the same scene
** Built-in support for several template brains: Drosophila, zebrafish, and Allen CCF (Allen Mouse Brain Atlas)
* [[SciView]] integration
* Quantitative, publication-quality visualization: Display neurons color coded by morphometric traits, or neuropil annotations. Export plots, reconstructions, diagrams and histograms as vector graphics

=== Backwards Compatibility ===
* Special effort was put into backwards compatibility with older Simple Neurite Tracer releases (including [[TrakEM2]] and [[SNT:_Tubular_Geodesics|ITK interaction]]). Inherited functionality has been improved, namely:
** Extended support for sub-pixel accuracy
** Improved synchronization of XY, ZY, and XZ views
** Improved calls to Dijkstra’s filling and Path-fitting routines
** Multi-threading improvements


== Installation ==

=== ''Regular'' Releases ===

SNT is currently distributed through the ''NeuroAnatomy'' [[Update_Sites|update site]]. For full functionality, subscription to the [[SciView]] update site is also required.

The first time you start SNT from Fiji’s menu structure ({{bc|Plugins|Neuroanatomy|SNT}} (or its backwards-compatible alias {{bc|Plugins|NeuroAnatomy|SNT|Legacy|Simple Neurite Tracer...}} ) you should be prompted for automatic subscription and download of required dependencies. If not, to manually subscribe to the required update sites:

# Run the Fiji [[Updater]] ({{bc|Help|Update..}}, the penultimate entry in the {{bc|Help|}} menu)
# Click ''Manage update sites''
# Select the ''Neuroanatomy'' and ''SciView'' checkboxes
# Click ''Apply changes'' and restart Fiji

=== ''Bleeding Edge'' Releases ===

Daily builds of SNT and SciView are pushed to the ''Neuroanatomy-Unstable'' and ''SciView-Unstable'' updated sites. Note that there is nothing inherently ''unstable'' with these builds: this nomenclature is adopted from the [https://www.debian.org/releases/ Debian release cycle]. Since the sites are not part of the official list, you have to specify their location to the updater:
  <ol>
    <li>
Run the Fiji [[Updater]] ({{bc|Help|Update..}}, the penultimate entry in the {{bc|Help|&nbsp;}} menu)
    </li>
    <li>
Click ''Manage update sites''
    </li>
    <li>
Add the following entries to the ''Manage update sites'' table, by clicking on ''Add update site'':

    </li>
    <li>
Activate the newly added ''Neuroanatomy-edge'' and ''SciView-edge'' checkboxes (if subscribed to ''regular releases'', un-select ''Neuroanatomy'' and ''SciView'')
    </li>
