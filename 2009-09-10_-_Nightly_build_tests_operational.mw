Long time ago, Mark Longair suggested to have nightly builds of the complete sources in [http://fiji.sc/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=fiji.git fiji.git].  Finally we have it up and running.

For those who are interested in some trivia:

* The nightly build runs every night at 3:14am.
* If the build fails (and only then), a mail is sent to [mailto:fiji-devel@googlegroups.com the fiji-devel mailing list], with details.
* The build will only test what is in the main development branch (''master'').
* Only the main project is built (''fiji.git''; subprojects, such as [[TrakEM2]] are not being rebuilt).
* To ensure compatibility with [[MacOSX tips|32-bit MacOSX]], we build against Java 5 (update 19, to be precise).
