== Installation ==

Add FPBioimage to your 'Update' sites:

# Launch the updater by selecting '''Update''' from the '''Help''' menu.
# Click the '''Manage update sites''' button.
# Tick the '''FPBioimage''' box: [[File:FPB-manage-update-sites.png|700px|center]]
# Click the '''Close''' button. The updater should now want to install or update some files: [[File:FPB-jars-to-update.png|700px|center]]
# Click the '''Apply changes''' button.
# Restart Fiji when prompted.

=== Manual Installation ===

If you want to install FPBioimage manually, copy the [https://github.com/fpBioImage/FPBioimageHelper-FIJI/releases|latest .jar release] to the Fiji/plugins folder. 

== Usage ==

FPBioimage Helper will appear under the '''Plugins''' menu of ImageJ. Open an image stack, then click it to run the plugin! 

Note that, to ensure color appears correctly in the web app, images must be of type RGB. You can change the type of your image by selecting from the menus: Image > Type > RGB Color. 

FPBioimage Helper will set the XYZ voxel ratio from the image properties (Image > Properties...), although you can overwrite this data in the plugin in case it is incorrect.
