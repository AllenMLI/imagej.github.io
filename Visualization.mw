{{BigNotice | See [[:Category:Visualization]] for pages about scientific visualization.}}
{{Learn | techniques}}[[wikipedia:Scientific visualization|Scientific visualization]] is a set of techniques for graphically illustrating scientific data, enabling scientists to better understand, illustrate, and glean insight from their data.

== Getting Started with Simple Visualization Options in ImageJ ==
=== False-color look-up tables (LUTs) ===
=== Brightness/Contrast ===
=== Visualization of Volumetric Image Data ===
Here we summarize some of the 3D visualization plugins in ImageJ.

|[https://imagej.net/3D_Viewer 3D Viewer]
|A tool for hardware-accelerated visualization possibilities for image stacks, using the [[Java 3D]] library.
|
* Stacks can be displayed as texture-based volume renderings, surfaces, or orthoslices
* Macro-recordable functions
* Adjust the transfer functions, edit volumes, point lists, landmark-based registration, transformations, 3D Content in PDFs

|-
|[http://imagej.net/MaMuT MaMuT] ('''Ma'''ssive '''Mu'''lti-view '''T'''racker)
|A tool for manual and semi-automatic tracking in multiple views.
|
* Allows browsing, annotating, and curating annotations for large image data
* Combines [http://imagej.net/BigDataViewer BigDataViewer] and [http://imagej.net/TrackMate TrackMate] 
* Ships [http://imagej.net/TrackScheme TrackScheme], the lineage browser taken from [http://imagej.net/TrackMate TrackMate]

|-
|[http://imagej.net/BigWarp BigWarp]
|A tool for manual, interactive, landmark-based deformable image alignment.
|
* Uses [http://imagej.net/BigDataViewer BigDataViewer] for visualization and navigation
* Uses a [[wikipedia:Thin_plate_spline|Thin Plate Spline]] implemented {{GitHub|org=saalfeldlab|repo=bigwarp|label=in Java}} to build a deformation from point correspondences
* Enables landmark pair placement and displays the effects of the warp on-the-fly
