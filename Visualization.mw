{{Learn | techniques}}[[wikipedia:Scientific visualization|Scientific visualization]] is a set of techniques for graphically illustrating scientific data, enabling scientists to better understand, illustrate, and glean insight from their data.

== Getting Started with Simple Visualization Options in ImageJ ==
=== Pseudocolor Image Look-Up Tables (LUTs) ===

A [http://imagej.net/Color_Image_Processing#Pseudo-color pseudocolor image] is a single channel gray image (8, 16 or 32-bit) that has color assigned to it via a lookup table, i.e. a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookup_table#Lookup_tables_in_image_processing LUT]. A LUT is a predefined table of gray values with matching red, green, and blue values so that shadows of gray are displayed as colorized pixels. Thus, differences in color in the pseudo-colored image reflect differences in intensity of the object rather than differences in color of the specimen that has been imaged.

The [http://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-19.html#sub:LUTMenu LUT Menu] of ImageJ contains a large collection of lookup tables that can be applied to a pseudocolor image.

Note: in the ImageJ 1.x user interface, LUTs are always 8-bit. When working with an image of higher bit depth, its intensity values are binned into 256 levels between minimum and maximum (see section Brightness/Contrast), and the LUT is applied onto these binned levels.

More information on this topic can be found on the [http://imagej.net/Color_Image_Processing Color Image Processing] page.

Fluorescence images are usually acquired without color information (i.e. by monochrome cameras or with photomultipliers): each channel contains just intensity values. To display a multi-channel fluorescence image in composite mode (i.e. an overlay of all channels), each channel can be assigned a '''monochrome false-color LUT''', e.g. 'Red', 'Green', 'Blue', 'Cyan', 'Magenta', 'Yellow', etc.

When analyzing quantitative data in an image, a false-color LUT (in this case also referred to as '''color map''') can increase the visibility of low-contrasted features in the image and help the human eye to compare different images.

Here's a list of recommended options to choose a LUT:

|-
|'''LUT Name'''
|'''Properties'''
|'''Common Usage'''
|'''Histogram'''
|-
|'''mpl-viridis'''
|
* ''Perceptually uniform''<ref>https://bids.github.io/colormap/</ref>
* Dark-to-Bright mapping
| Quantitative display of positive values on a continuous scale

|-
|'''HiLo'''
|
* Minimum of display range is blue
* Maximum of display range is red
* Normal gray-scale LUT for all other values

=== Adjusting your Image in ImageJ ===

The [http://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-28.html#toc-Subsection-28.2 Adjust submenu] contains commands that adjust [http://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-28.html#sub:Brightness/Contrast...%5BC%5D Brightness/Contrast], [http://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-28.html#sub:Threshold...%5BT%5D Threshold] levels, and image [http://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-28.html#sub:Size... Size].
