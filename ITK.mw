The Insight Toolkit (ITK) is a cross-platform, [[open-source]] application development framework widely used for the development of image [[segmentation]] and image registration programs.

=ITK integration with ImageJ=

Although ITK is a C++ application, many ITK functions are available in ImageJ through the [http://www.simpleitk.org/ SimpleITK] Java compatibility layer.

Enabling this functionality in ImageJ is simply a matter of turning on the [[List_of_update_sites|ImageJ-ITK update site]]. Note that this will trigger a large download, as it requires the SimpleITK native library (up to a few hundred MB).

==What's on the update site?==

===User-focused===
* SimpleITK 0.90 is distributed with this update.  After update all SimpleITK classes can be called from the script editor. 
* When using <code>@itkImage</code> [[Script_paramters|parameters]] in scripts, the active ImageJ <code>Dataset(s)</code> will be converted to SimpleITK <code>Image(s)</code>
* There are several templates in the [[Scripting|script editor]] demonstrating ITK use.  The following example shows how to perform Otsu multilevel threshold using SimpleITK

<source lang="python">
# @org.itk.simple.Image image
# @OUTPUT Dataset output

from org.itk.simple import OtsuMultipleThresholdsImageFilter

otsu = OtsuMultipleThresholdsImageFilter()

# call itk rl using simple itk wrapper
output = otsu.execute(image, 2, 0, 255, True)
</source>

===Developer-focused===
* All SimpleITK Java classes
* Automatic ITK <code>Image</code> to ImageJ <code>Dataset</code> conversion with the [https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/blob/scijava-common-2.47.0/src/main/java/org/scijava/convert/ConvertService.java ConvertService]
