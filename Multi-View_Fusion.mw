== Overview of the multi-view fusion plugin ==

The multi-view fusion plugin is able to combine several 3d acquistions of the same specimen taken from different viewpoints (this includes different tiles) into one single output image. This can be done for single timepoints or an entire timeseries. Prerequisite for the fusion is an aligned dataset, an overview of the complete registration and fusion process can be found [[SPIM_Registration|here]]. The registration can be achieved using one the following plugins:

* [[SPIM_Bead_Registration|Bead-based registration]]
* [[Segmentation-based registration]]

The multi-view fusion plugins offers two registration options:

* Single-channel
* Multi-channel

Note, that in order to fuse a multi-channel acquisition, a single-channel registration can be sufficient as the registration of one channel can be applied to other channels of the same timepoint. Both options work in the same way and have very similar options. The additional options of multi-channel registration are explained in the last section.

=== Creating a cropped output image ===

As the output images are typically very large, as the plugin by default fused the complete bounding box around all registered views. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to define a cropping area where only the imaged sample is positioned in the output image. If you do not have enough memory to create an uncropped output image, there is an option to first create a down-sampled version of the output image in which you can identify the cropping area. In a second run, you can create the fused image with full resolution only for the cropped area that contains the specimen. Note that when you define the cropping area in a downsampled image, you need to adjust the the values to the original scale. That is, if you downsample 2-fold, you have to multiply all coordinates by 2.

== What do I have to consider when I want to fuse a timeseries? ==

If you want to process a timeseries you should first run the fusion only for the reference timepoint in order to determine the correct cropping parameters. In a second run you can fuse the complete timeseries using these cropping parameters.

== How to use the plugin ==

[[Image:Spim multiview dialog1.jpg|thumb|300px|Shows the first dialog that queries the location of the multi-view files]]

The multi-view fusion consists of two consecutive dialogs. The first dialog queries the information necessary to analyze the dataset. Please note that all the parameters will be looked up in the [[SPIM_Bead_Registration|Bead-based registration]] or [[Segmentation-based registration]], so typically just pressing ok is sufficient. However,
