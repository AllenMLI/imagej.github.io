BigDataServer: INFO__ are linkish? An issue with automatic reformatting?
wikipedia: links won't work -- in e.g. Downloads -- need include instead
Lots of dead links to defunct pages e.g. Irc__

[:Category:...] links won't work.
[File:...] won't work.
[Special:...] won't work.
User: won't work.

DokuWiki_Migration needs updating to cover GitHub Pages instead of MediaWiki.

SWF files can't be played, and are not easy to get converted now.
- Need someone with an old system that plays them? Ugh.

There are some captures in _includes that might be unnecessary.
E.g. macos captures include.content into info_content, then recapitulates it below.
Is this to make markdown=1 work as desired? Further testing needed.

id="infobox" or id="info-box" instead of class="info-box". Are these boxes unique to the page? If not, shouldn't be ids.
And lots of infoboxes. Need to consolidate them, remove unnecessary ones, and so forth.

News page needs to liquid loop over all news articles, and show them in a grid like before.
And consider showing blurbs for the last couple of articles with "read more" or some such.

"OS X" should be changed to "macOS" everywhere now.

Unify the top nav bar and main menu. (Wait for Sam?)

Unify search.imagej.net with imagej.net's search function.
All mentions of search.imagej.net should instead link to the new unified mechanism.

Remove pre-introductory-paragraph headings from all pages.

Consider shifting main menu and TOC upward a bit.

Add disambig notice for mtrack / mtrack2 / mtrackj

Continue massaging out unwanted characters:
git grep -P -n "[^\x00-\x7F αβλχΔΠπτΨ∑σµμ ©® ° ⁰¹²³⁵⁶⁷₁₂≥≈≠≤≥±−×÷√≪≫∗★ ←→↓↑↩︎ †§ ÄÈÁÉÍÓÚČŠàèáćéíóúýãñäëïöüůêôčěňřšžßç 😁 ⌥⌘⏎ –—─│┌┐└┘├█″′«»]"

Convert plain menu paths using &gt; or '/' to bc template:
git grep '\(File\|Edit\|Image\|Process\|Analyze\|Plugins\|Window\|Help\) *\(&gt;\|\/\) *[A-Za-z \.]*\(\(&gt;\|\/\)[A-Za-z \.]*\)*'

Unify all keyboard things (e.g. <span class="Keystroke">) to use key template.

Decide what to do about dashes: - – — ─

Double check all <span> elements in _pages. Are they necessary?

Fix links hardcoding imagej.net.

Fix all citations to use an include.

Fix ad hoc "*Note: asdf*" blurbs to use an include.

Rename plugins/stitching-2d-3d to plugins/stitching

SNT has custom styling. Ideal would be to generalize it.

bc now has dotted underlines, but tooltip does also. Differentiate them.

No template should use "content=" -- be more specific.

Add a refresh button next to the statbox, if it's in javascript mode.

Combine plugins/spirals + plugins/spirals-macro
