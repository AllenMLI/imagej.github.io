== Noise Generator ==

It is well know that in every image acquisition process exist a noise level always present by different sources. Each noise has its particular characteristics and the behavior on image acquisition plays an importanto role to quantify the reliability on further image manipulations such as registration and tissue segmentation.




'''Update notes:'''

*''Feb-04-2015'': Available to produce additive noise on 2D images with some specific noise probability distributions. It is produced in the majority the MRI and complex noise distributions.
