## <a name="Introduction"></a> **Introduction**

While in Clojure one is able to declare types if desired, it's not required; the low computational requirements of the plugin do not invite to make it verbose unnecessarily. But java demands type declarations just so that the plugin can be compiled and thus a binary .class file generated.

While both the java and clojure versions encapsulate the variables in a local namespace -in Clojure, by using let statements to declare local variables-, the jython version does not, so they are all global when defined outside the class definition. One can achieve, though, variable encapsulation by declaring the entire script inside a class or function definition -but its not required as in java, neither as natural and straightforward as in Clojure.

## <a name="Imbedded images in table"></a> **Imbedded images in table**

A table with images, use the .image.table to make it align with text:

| :---: | :---: |
|![Plugins]({{"/images/icons/plugins_icon.png" | relative_url}}){: .image.table} | A powerful mechanism for extending ImageJ in all kinds of useful ways. 
| ![Extend]({{"/images/icons/extend_icon.png" | relative_url}}){: .image.table} | Automated, reproducible workflows via scripts and macros, including headless on a remote server or cluster. |

## <a name="Math equations"></a> **Math equations**

When $$a \ne 0$$ , there are two solutions to $$(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$$ and they are

$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

Wow such pretty math!
