ImageJA is a ''fork'' of [http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/ ImageJ], i.e. it is synchronized closely with ImageJ, but has a few things on top:

* When run as an applet, ImageJA is embedded (slated to be _optionally_ embedded, once the maintainer finds some time to do it).
* The internal structure of ImageJA's recorder allows command listeners to get much more fine-grained information.
* When launching a text editor, in many cases ImageJA will now choose Fiji's Script Editor, if available, instead of the old AWT based ImageJ editor.
* ImageJA has an easy Plugin installer via Plugins>Install PlugIn... (ImageJ only has that drag-n-drop thingie).
* The instance listener is RMI-based with ImageJA, so there is no security issue with it.
* ImageJA's Command Launcher has fuzzy matching, too.
* A couple of bug fixes:
** JavaScript in ImageJA can find plugin classes, too.
** ImageJA also put back some not-yet-deprecated methods as deprecated.
** A simple bug fix in PolygonRoi drawing (it moves to the first point, but then draws a line to the same first point rather than the second).
** A little bug fix in StackWindow: if you have a 2D time lapse, ImageJ will still use the zSelector (rather than the tSelector).
** ImageJA can handle https:// URLs, too.
