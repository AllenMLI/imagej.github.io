ImageJA is a project that provides a clean Git History of the ImageJ 1.x branch, with a proper 'pom.xml' file so that it can be used with Maven without hassles.

== Historical note ==

ImageJA was [https://list.nih.gov/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=IMAGEJ;cd841de0.0510 launched in 2005] as a ''fork'' of [[ImageJ]]; i.e., it was synchronized closely with ImageJ with a few changes on top:

* When run as an applet, ImageJA is embedded (slated to be _optionally_ embedded, once the maintainer finds some time to do it).
* The internal structure of ImageJA's recorder allows command listeners to get much more fine-grained information.
* When launching a text editor, in many cases ImageJA will now choose Fiji's Script Editor, if available, instead of the old AWT based ImageJ editor.
* ImageJA has an easy Plugin installer via Plugins>Install PlugIn... (ImageJ only has that drag-n-drop thingie).
* The instance listener is RMI-based with ImageJA, so there is no security issue with it.
* ImageJA's Command Launcher has fuzzy matching, too.
* A couple of bug fixes:
** JavaScript in ImageJA can find plugin classes, too.
** ImageJA also put back some not-yet-deprecated methods as deprecated.
** A simple bug fix in PolygonRoi drawing (it moves to the first point, but then draws a line to the same first point rather than the second).
** A little bug fix in StackWindow: if you have a 2D time lapse, ImageJ will still use the zSelector (rather than the tSelector).
** ImageJA can handle https:// URLs, too.

== Where is the applet used? ==

To the knowledge of the author of the advanced applet parts of ImageJA, the applet is used at least here:

* [http://embl.de/ EMBL], for an internal web-based interface to a high-throughput system
* [http://mpi-cbg.de/ MPI-CBG], to display ''C.elegans'' databases
* In at least one [http://www.science-approach.com/ commercial e-learning website].
