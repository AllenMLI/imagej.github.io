== Overview ==

The FIBSEM importer is able to read the image files produced by the FIB-SEM machine at Janelia Farm. It can be used via:

* Drag & Drop
* File > Import > FIB-SEM ...

It will be opened as unsigned 16-bit data ranging from 0 to 65535, where 0 corresponds to a detector voltage of -10 volts and 65535 to a voltage of +10 volts. It will automatically set the pixel resolution in the image calibration.

For access to all the other meta-data, see the special options paragraph below.

== Special options ==

=== Open image as float ===

It might make sense to open the image as float and not convert it into an unsigned short. To do so, one can set a switch in the FIBSEM importer using the '''script editor''':
* File > New > Script
* Language > Beanshell
* type the following lines
<source lang="java">
import io.FIBSEM_Reader;
FIBSEM_Reader.openAsFloat = true;
</source>
* click Run

From now on, every FIBSEM image of the '''currently running Fiji instance''' will be opened as float, the float values represent directly the measured voltage for each pixel.
