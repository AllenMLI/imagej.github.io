== Overview ==

The FIBSEM importer is able to read the image files produced by the FIB-SEM machine at Janelia Farm. It can be used via:

* Drag & Drop
* File > Import > FIB-SEM ...

It will be opened as unsigned 16-bit data ranging from 0 to 65535, where 0 corresponds to a detector voltage of -10 volts and 65535 to a voltage of +10 volts. It will automatically set the pixel resolution in the image calibration.

For access to all the other meta-data, see the special options paragraph below.
