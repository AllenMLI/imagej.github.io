== Overview ==

The FIBSEM importer is able to read the image files produced by the FIB-SEM machine at Janelia Farm. It can be used via:

* Drag & Drop
* File > Import > FIB-SEM ...

It will be opened as unsigned 16-bit data ranging from 0 to 65535, where 0 corresponds to a detector voltage of -10 volts and 65535 to a voltage of +10 volts. It will automatically set the pixel resolution in the image calibration.

For access to all the other meta-data, see the special options paragraph below.

== Special options ==

=== Open image as float ===

It might make sense to open the image as float and not convert it into an unsigned short. To do so, one can set a switch in the FIBSEM importer using the '''script editor''':
* File > New > Script
* Language > Beanshell
* type the following lines
<source lang="java">
import io.FIBSEM_Reader;
FIBSEM_Reader.openAsFloat = true;
</source>
* click Run

From now on, every FIBSEM image of the '''currently running Fiji instance''' will be opened as float, the float values represent directly the measured voltage for each pixel.

=== Access the complete metadata ===

In order to access the complete metadata you have to make a new instance of the FIBSEM importer, load the dataset and afterwards request the metadata object. Here is the code how do it using the script editor and the Beanshell language (see above):

<source lang="java">
import io.FIBSEM_Reader;
import io.FIBSEM_Reader.FIBSEMData;

// open the file
FIBSEM_Reader reader = new FIBSEM_Reader();
reader.run( "/Users/preibischs/Desktop/Zeiss_12-01-14_210123.dat" );

// get the metadata
FIBSEMData metadata = reader.getHeader();

// print all data into the log window
IJ.log( "" + metadata );

// print a single field
IJ.log( "The resolution of the image is " + metadata.xRes + " x " + metadata.yRes + " pixels." );</source>
