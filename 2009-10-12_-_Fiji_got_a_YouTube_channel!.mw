Thanks to the effort of [http://bioweb.cnb.csic.es/~iarganda/index_EN.html Ignacio Arganda-Carreras], we have a [http://www.youtube.com/user/fijichannel channel on YouTube]!

This channel has a few tutorials and a fun view of the Fiji development already, and we will add other movies as we make them.
