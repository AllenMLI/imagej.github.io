== Install ==

=== ImageJ update site ===
The CSBDeep plugin can be installed from the ImageJ update site [http://sites.imagej.net/CSBDeep/]. See the [https://github.com/CSBDeep/CSBDeep_website/wiki/CSBDeep-in-Fiji CSBDeep Wiki Pages] for more details.

=== From source ===
# Clone this repository.
# Run the following command from inside the repo:
<code>
mvn -Dimagej.app.directory=/path/to/Fiji.app/ -Ddelete.other.versions=true
</code>

== Run demos ==
# Download the [http://csbdeep.bioimagecomputing.com/exemplary-image-data.zip exemplary image data]
# Open Fiji.
# Open an example image, e.g. `tribolium.tif`.
# Run the plugin via `Plugins > CSBDeep > Demo`.
# Run the plugin by pressing `Ok`.

If all goes well, an image will be displayed representing the result of the model execution.

See the [https://github.com/CSBDeep/CSBDeep_website/wiki/CSBDeep-in-Fiji CSBDeep Wiki Pages] for more details.

== Run your own model ==
# Use the [https://github.com/CSBDeep/CSBDeep python code] to train your network with your data. Export it as ZIP.
# Open Fiji.
# Open an image.
# Run the plugin for any network via `Plugins > CSBDeep > Run your network`.
# Load your exported network by pressing `Browse` on the `Import model (.zip)` line.
# Run the plugin by pressing `Ok`.

If all goes well, an image will be displayed representing the result of the model execution.

See the [https://github.com/CSBDeep/CSBDeep_website/wiki/Your-Model-in-Fiji CSBDeep Wiki Page] for more details.

== Develop ==

=== Code Style ===

If you use eclipse you can import our code formatter `doc/eclipse-code-formatter.xml`, code cleanup (`doc/eclipse-code-clean-up.xml`) and import order (`eclipse-import-order.importorder`) settings.

== GPU support ==

For GPU support we load the TensorFlow JNI with GPU support manually when a command is initialized. This means that the GPU version of the TensorFLow JNI must be accessible in the java library path (For example `Fiji.app/lib/linux64` in a Fiji installation).

See the according [https://github.com/CSBDeep/CSBDeep_website/wiki/CSBDeep-in-Fiji-–-Installation#gpu-support CSBDeep Wiki page] for a detailed installation guide.

=== Muliple GPUs ===

See the according [https://github.com/CSBDeep/CSBDeep_website/wiki/CSBDeep-in-Fiji-–-Installation#multiple-gpus CSBDeep Wiki page].
