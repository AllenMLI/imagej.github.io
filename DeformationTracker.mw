ETrack is a tool, which computes the deformation of elliptically shaped deformed cells such as Embryo cells images by either bright-field or fluorescent microscopy. 

For using ETrack you have to provide a superpixel segmentation map of your cells in the timelapse image along with the original timelapse image coming out of the microscope.
