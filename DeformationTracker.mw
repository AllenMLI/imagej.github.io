{{ComponentStats:net.imagej:ETrack}}
ETrack is a tool, which computes the deformation of elliptically shaped deformed cells such as Embryo cells images by either bright-field or fluorescent microscopy. 

For using ETrack you have to provide a superpixel segmentation map of your cells in the timelapse image along with the original timelapse image coming out of the microscope.


== Installation ==

== Usage ==

=== Automated Curvature Measurement ===
A typical dataset consists of a single two-dimensional (2d) image of the cells whose surface is oscillating over time. 
The file format
can be any format readable by Fiji/Bioformats (.tif, .nd2, … ). To run the tracker select {{bc|Plugins|ETrack|Automated angle and curvature measurement}}
