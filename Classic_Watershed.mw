== Introduction ==
Classic Watershed is an ImageJ/Fiji plugin to perform watershed on a grayscale 2D/3D image using flooding simulations, as described by Pierre Soille and Luc M. Vincent (1990).

== Usage == 


== Installation ==

The Classic Watershed plugin is part of the IJPB-plugins library. To install it, you just need to [[How_to_follow_a_3rd_party_update_site#Add_update_sites | add]] the IJPB-plugins update site:

1) Select ''Help > Update...'' from the Fiji menu to start the updater.

2) Click on ''Manage update sites''. This brings up a dialog where you can activate additional update sites.

3) Activate the IJPB-plugins update site and close the dialog. Now you should see an additional jar file for download.

4) Click ''Apply changes'' and restart Fiji.

You should now find the plugin under the sub-menu ''Plugins > Segmentation''.

'''Note''': Classic Watershed is only one of the plugins included in the IJPB-plugins suite. By following these installation steps, you will be installing as well the rest of plugins in the suite.
