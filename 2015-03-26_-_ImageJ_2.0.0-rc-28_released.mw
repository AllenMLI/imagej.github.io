Today, the [[Contributors|ImageJ team]] is pleased to announce a new public release candidate for [[ImageJ2]]: version 2.0.0-rc-28.

== What's new ==

=== Console window ===

The main new feature of this release is a Console window that tracks all output to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams standard output and error streams]. Previously, all output to these streams was silently discarded unless the Debug option in Edit > Options > Misc was enabled prior to any issues.

Now, all that has changed: the [[SciJava Common]] library gained a new feature to track the standard streams ([https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/commit/28f717b9684047f9df5e3deee10cbcee81334b97 scijava-common/28f717b9]), and the relevant ImageJ user interfaces added a dedicated Console window which pops up whenever output is sent to the error stream ([https://github.com/scijava/scijava-ui-swing/commit/361bc585d9ae833bb0d4b47c0a6cda7485d40357 scijava-ui-swing/361bc585], [https://github.com/imagej/imagej-legacy/commit/0956b34185c16c9f5ca82504d24e27371e3249ed imagej-legacy/0956b341]).

This change has important consequences for users. Previously, if a script or plugin issued an error message, it would often be silently discarded with the user never seeing it. For example, see script right: that buggy [[Python]] script tries to open a non-existent file. Prior to the Console window, the script would appear to "hang" with no feedback to indicate it crashed. Now, an error appears in red to make it clear to that something went wrong.

Note that output to the standard ''output'' stream does not cause the Console to appear, because there are many ImageJ plugins in the wild (e.g., [[Bio-Formats]]) that emit information output to that stream. The Console will only appear automatically when output to the standard ''error'' stream occurs. However, you can bring it up any time by choosing Console from the bottom of the Window menu.

The Console feature still has some rough edgesâ€”as always, [[Report a Bug|bug reports]] are welcome. But we believe this change is an important step forward to avoid confusion and improve the [Bug reporting best practices|quality of bug reports] overall.

=== Better ImageJ2 data structure syncing ===

The "Enable ImageJ2 data structures" option in Edit > Options > ImageJ2 has been removed, and is now off by default ([https://github.com/imagej/imagej-legacy/commit/231b76517f45993b5dfc4b1ddcaf8a14ff04491d imagej-legacy/231b7651]). We have not had time to complete this feature, and it currently causes substantial performance issues enabled, so we want to be absolutely certain that no one enables it naively or by accident. It is still possible for interested developers to toggle the feature on by setting the <code>imagej.legacy.sync</code> environment variable.

Regardless, that feature is also less important now that we do on-demand syncing when encountering an ImageJ2 command or script parameter, such as a <code>net.imagej.Dataset</code>. This release also fixes a bug surrounding that on-demand syncing, which caused it to be triggered unnecessarily ([https://github.com/imagej/imagej-common/commit/92e59826bde0642f217e07b38c161087b15538d0 imagej-common/92e59826]).

Thanks to Greg for the [http://imagej.1557.x6.nabble.com/Running-scripts-with-an-open-Virtual-Hyperstack-tp5012163p5012175.html bug report on the ImageJ mailing list]!

=== Bug fixes ===

Lastly, as usual, this release includes various small enhancements and fixes (e.g., [https://github.com/imagej/imagej-legacy/commit/4ab513259fa85bef083eae8923b3755a0ac0703d imagej-legacy/4ab51325]).
