The [http://scif.io/ SCIFIO] library (SCientific Image Format Input and Output) is focused on robust and extensible support for reading and writing image file formats. It is included with [[ImageJ2]].

Using it with ImageJ provides many advantages:

* The ''File > Open'' command works with SCIFIO automatically.
* There is a [[Bio-Formats]] plugin for SCIFIO that adds automatic support for all Bio-Formats formats.
* Additional SCIFIO format plugins can be dropped into ImageJ and will also work automatically.
* Unlike the ImageJ 1.x TIFF implementation, SCIFIO's support for TIFF adheres to the specification, allowing to successfully read many more sorts of TIFFs.
* Similarly, SCIFIO supports more sorts of JPEG files since it uses its own JPEG decoder.
* SCIFIO also ships with support for several QuickTime codecs, allowing ImageJ to read QuickTime MOV files even in 64-bit mode without QuickTime for Java.
* SCIFIO supports many additional open file formats out of the box:
** animated GIF
** animated PNG
** encapsulated postscript (EPS)
** JPEG-2000
** Micro-Manager datasets
** Multi-image Network Graphics (MNG)
** Nearly Raw Raster Data (NRRD)
** Imspector OBF
** OME-TIFF (multidimensional rich metadata TIFF)
** OME-XML
** PCX
** PICT (even in 64-bit mode and/or without QuickTime for Java installed)
* If SCIFIO cannot handle the image file, it falls back to ImageJ 1.x.
