Suggestions for further development:

# A preview window when selecting method. A portion of the image would be shown, next to the segmented portion, using the method currently chosen. It would automatically refresh when changing method.
# Working indifferently on 8-bit and 16-bit images.

I like the idea of the preview window. The current menu just waits for the the input.

16 bit images and 32 bit images are, I think, binned into 256 levels. I have to look a bit more in detail how this is done in IJ.
