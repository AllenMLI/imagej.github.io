{{Development}}
The [[ImageJ]] and related [[SciJava]] projects take advantage of several project management tools.

== Git ==

ImageJ uses the [[Git]] revision control system to manage its [[source code]].

== Maven ==

ImageJ uses [[Maven]] for its project infrastructure.

Maven artifacts are published to the [http://maven.imagej.net/ ImageJ Maven repository].

Releases are versioned with [http://semver.org/ Semantic Versioning].

== Issue tracking ==

ImageJ manages tasks and priorities using [https://github.com/organizations/imagej/dashboard/issues/repos GitHub Issues]:

* [https://github.com/imagej/imagej/issues/milestones ImageJ release milestones]
* [https://github.com/scifio/scifio/issues/milestones SCIFIO release milestones]

Previously, the project used [http://trac.imagej.net/ Trac] for issue tracking and roadmapping, but all Trac issues are now being migrated to GitHub. See these links:

* [http://trac.imagej.net/roadmap ImageJ Trac roadmap] - early milestones
* [http://trac.imagej.net/report/1 ImageJ Features report] - a high-level list of features slated for each release
* [http://trac.imagej.net/timeline ImageJ Trac timeline] - a fine-grained list of changes to ImageJ

== Continuous integration ==

ImageJ has a [http://jenkins.imagej.net/ Jenkins server], which automatically checks the code for build and test errors.

You can access Jenkins's last successful build artifacts from the [http://developer.imagej.net/downloads ImageJ2 Downloads] page.

== Other roadmap links ==

* [[News]] about ImageJ and Fiji developments, including status updates, observations and comments about ImageJ programming.
* [[Special:RecentChanges|Recent changes]] to this web site (''not'' the ImageJ code itself).
* [http://fiji.sc/bugzilla BugZilla] database of user-reported bugs from the [[Report a Bug]] plugin.
