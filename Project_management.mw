{{Development}}
The [[ImageJ]] and related [[SciJava]] projects take advantage of several project management tools.

== Git ==

ImageJ uses the [[Git]] revision control system to manage its [[source code]].

== Maven ==

ImageJ uses [[Maven]] for its project infrastructure.

Maven artifacts are published to the [http://maven.imagej.net/ ImageJ Maven repository].

Releases are [[Architecture#Versioning|versioned with Semantic Versioning]].

=== The ImageJ Maven repository ===

We maintain a [http://maven.imagej.net/ Maven binary repository] (using [http://www.sonatype.com/nexus Sonatype Nexus]) for managing SciJava libraries. Such a repository serves two main purposes:

# '''Proxying.''' It acts as an on-demand mirror for the public Maven repositories, reducing load on the central Maven server and potentially reducing local build times.
# '''Deployment.''' It provides a place to store our JAR artifacts, including snapshot versions, without the [http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-central-repository-upload.html red tape] of submitting to central Maven repository.

The second purpose is especially important for agile development across multiple components. For more details, see [http://books.sonatype.com/nexus-book/reference/repoman-sect-reasons.html Reasons to Use a Repository Manager].

=== Deploying artifacts ===

To deploy JARs, POMs and other artifacts to the ImageJ Maven repository, you will first need a user account. Assuming you have one, follow these steps:

<ol>
<li>Verify that you can log in to the [http://maven.imagej.net/ Nexus web UI] using your credentials.</li>
<li>Install the following <code>settings.xml</code> and <code>settings-security.xml</code> into your Maven configuration directory (typically <code>~/.m2</code>):
<p>
<code>settings-security.xml</code>
<source lang="xml">
<settingsSecurity>
  <master>[YOUR MASTER HASH]</master>
</settingsSecurity>
</source>
</p>
<p>
<code>settings.xml</code>
<source lang="xml">
<settings>

  <!--
  Credentials for artifact deployment to ImageJ Nexus; see:
  http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html
  -->
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>imagej.releases</id>
      <username>[YOUR USERNAME]</username>
      <password>[YOUR PASSWORD HASH]</password>
    </server>
    <server>
      <id>imagej.snapshots</id>
      <username>[YOUR USERNAME]</username>
      <password>[YOUR PASSWORD HASH]</password>
    </server>
  </servers>

  <!--
  ImageJ Nexus central mirror configuration; see:
  http://books.sonatype.com/nexus-book/reference/maven-sect-single-group.html
  -->

  <mirrors>
    <mirror>
      <!--This sends everything else to /public -->
      <id>nexus</id>
      <mirrorOf>*</mirrorOf>
      <url>http://maven.imagej.net/content/groups/public</url>
    </mirror>
  </mirrors>
  <profiles>
    <profile>
      <id>nexus</id>
      <!--Enable snapshots for the built in central repo to direct -->
      <!--all requests to nexus via the mirror -->
      <repositories>
        <repository>
          <id>central</id>
          <url>http://central</url>
          <releases><enabled>true</enabled></releases>
          <snapshots><enabled>true</enabled></snapshots>
        </repository>
      </repositories>
     <pluginRepositories>
        <pluginRepository>
          <id>central</id>
          <url>http://central</url>
          <releases><enabled>true</enabled></releases>
          <snapshots><enabled>true</enabled></snapshots>
        </pluginRepository>
      </pluginRepositories>
    </profile>
  </profiles>
  <activeProfiles>
    <!--make the profile active all the time -->
    <activeProfile>nexus</activeProfile>
  </activeProfiles>
</settings>
</source>
</p>
</li>
<li>Replace instances of <code>[YOUR USERNAME]</code> in <code>settings.xml</code> with your Nexus username.</li>
<li>Follow the [http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html directions for encrypting your password] to generate a master hash and a password hash.</li>
<li>Replace <code>[YOUR MASTER HASH]</code> in <code>settings-security.xml</code> with your master hash.</li>
<li>Replace <code>[YOUR PASSWORD HASH]</code> in <code>settings.xml</code> with your password hash.</li>
</ol>
Once you have followed these steps, it should be possible to deploy snapshot JARs to the Nexus using the <code>mvn deploy</code> command. Note that if you deploy an umbrella project, it is normal to receive an eventual build failure when attempting to deploy the umbrella project itselfâ€”all component modules should deploy successfully before that, though.

== Issue tracking ==

ImageJ manages tasks and priorities using [https://github.com/organizations/imagej/dashboard/issues/repos GitHub Issues]:

* [https://github.com/imagej/imagej/issues/milestones ImageJ release milestones]
* [https://github.com/scifio/scifio/issues/milestones SCIFIO release milestones]

Previously, the project used [http://trac.imagej.net/ Trac] for issue tracking and roadmapping, but all Trac issues are now being migrated to GitHub. See these links:

* [http://trac.imagej.net/roadmap ImageJ Trac roadmap] - early milestones
* [http://trac.imagej.net/report/1 ImageJ Features report] - a high-level list of features slated for each release
* [http://trac.imagej.net/timeline ImageJ Trac timeline] - a fine-grained list of changes to ImageJ

== Patch submissions ==

The preferred mechanism to contribute improvements to [[ImageJ]] and other [[SciJava]] components is using [https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/ GitHub pull requests]! See the [[Contributing]] page for details.
 
== Continuous integration ==

ImageJ has a [http://jenkins.imagej.net/ Jenkins server], which automatically checks the code for build and test errors.

You can access Jenkins's last successful build artifacts from the [[Downloads]] page.

== Other roadmap links ==

* [[News]] about ImageJ and Fiji developments, including status updates, observations and comments about ImageJ programming.
* [[Special:RecentChanges|Recent changes]] to this web site (''not'' the ImageJ code itself).
* [http://fiji.sc/bugzilla BugZilla] database of user-reported bugs from the [[Report a Bug]] plugin.
