{{Development}}
The [[ImageJ]] and related [[SciJava]] projects take advantage of several project management tools.

== Git ==

ImageJ uses the [[Git]] revision control system to manage its [[source code]].

== Maven ==

ImageJ uses [[Maven]] for its project infrastructure.

Maven artifacts are published to the [http://maven.imagej.net/ ImageJ Maven repository].

== Issue tracking ==

ImageJ uses [https://github.com/organizations/imagej/dashboard/issues/repos GitHub Issues] for issue tracking.

[[ImageJ2]] previously used [http://trac.imagej.net/ Trac] for issue tracking and roadmapping, but all Trac issues are now being migrated to GitHub.

== Continuous integration ==

ImageJ has a [http://jenkins.imagej.net/ Jenkins server], which automatically checks the code for build and test errors.

You can access Jenkins's last successful build artifacts from the [http://developer.imagej.net/downloads ImageJ2 Downloads] page.
