'''The problem with tracking algorithms is that they always give an answer.'''

This answer can be completely irrelevant, even non-physical, and there is no built-in flags that would indicate something wrong. The best way to avoid basing your downstream analysis on faulty tracking results is to know in what situation the tracker works the best, and what are its limitations. This is the aim of this page for the trackers and detectors shipped with [[TrackMate]].


== The ISBI 2012 single particle challenge. ==

In 2011-2012, an ISBI Grand Challenge was organized for the [http://bioimageanalysis.org/track/ Single-Particle Tracking algorithms]. Though TrackMate does not offer a completely new algorithm, product of an original Research work, we took the chance and participated in the challenge. The results and the methodology to compute the accuracy of a tracking algorithms were published<ref> [http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v11/n3/full/nmeth.2808.html Chenouard ''et al.'', Objective comparison of particle tracking methods. '''Nature Methods, 2014 ''']</ref> thereafter.

Unsurprisingly, we did not score amongst the best. At the time, TrackMate was in version 1.1, and ship a stripped down version of the better performing Jaqaman ''et al.'' LAP framework<ref name="Jaqaman">[http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v5/n8/full/nmeth.1237.html Jaqaman et al., "Robust single-particle tracking in live-cell time-lapse sequences", Nat Methods. 2008 Aug;5(8):695-702.]</ref>. See the [[TrackMate algorithms#LAP_trackers|LAP trackers section]] for algorithm details.
