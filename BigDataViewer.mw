== Description ==
The BigDataViewer is a re-slicing browser for terabyte-sized multi-view image sequences.
BigDataViewer was developed with multi-view light-sheet microscopy data in mind and integrates well with Fiji's SPIMage processing pipeline.

Conceptually, the visualized data comprises multiple ''data sources''.
Each source provides one 3D image (for each time-point in the case of a time-lapse sequence)
For example, in a multi-angle SPIM sequence, each angle is a source.
In a multi-angle, multi-channel SPIM sequence, each channel of each angle is a source.

BigDataViewer comes with a custom data format that is is optimized for fast random access to very large data sets.
This permits browsing to any location within a multi-terabyte recording in a fraction of a second.

The file format is based on XML and HDF5.
Images are represented as tiled multi-resolution pyramids, and stored in HDF5 chunked multi-dimensional arrays.
The XML file contains metadata, for example the registration of sources to the global coordinate system.

== Installation ==
To get BigDataViewer you need to enable its update site in the Fiji Updater.
Select ''Help > Update Fiji'' from the Fiji menu to start the updater.

[[Image:bdv-imagej-updater-1.png]]

Click on ''Manage update sites''. This brings up a dialog where you can activate additional update sites.

[[Image:bdv-manage-update-sites-1.png]]

Activate the BigDataViewer update site and ''Close'' the dialog.
Now you should see additional files appearing for download.

Click ''Apply changes'' and restart Fiji.

You should now have a sub-menu ''Plugins > BigDataViewer''.

== Usage ==
To use the BigDataViewer we need some example dataset to browse.
You can download a small dataset from
[http://fly.mpi-cbg.de/~pietzsch/bdv-example/ here], comprising two views and three time-points.
This is an excerpt of a 6 angle 715 time-point sequence of ''drosophila melanogaster'' embryonal development, imaged with a Zeiss Lightsheet Z.1.
Download both the XML and the HDF5 file and place them somewhere next to each other.

Alternatively, you can create a dataset by exporting your own data as described below.

=== Opening Dataset ===
To start BigDataViewer, select ''Plugins > BigDataViewer > Open XML/HDF5'' from the Fiji menu.
This brings up a file open dialog. Open the XML file of your test dataset.

=== Basic Navigation ===
You should see something like this:

[[Image:bdv-bdv-start.png]]

On startup, the middle slice of the first source (angle) is shown.
You can browse the stack using the keyboard or the mouse.
To get started, try the following:
* Use the mouse-wheel or {{key press|<}} and {{key press|>}} keys to scroll through z slices.
* {{key press|right-click|drag}} anywhere on the canvas to translate the image.
* Use {{key press|Ctrl|Shift|mouse-wheel}}, or {{key press|Up}} and {{key press|Down}} keys to zoom in and out.
* {{key press|left-click|drag}} anywhere on the canvas to rotate (reslice) the image.


The following table shows the available navigation commands using the mouse:

{| border="1" style="border-collapse:collapse;"
| style="padding: 5px;" | {{key press|left-click|drag}}
| style="padding: 5px;" | Rotate (pan and tilt) around the point where the mouse was clicked.
|-
| style="padding: 5px;" | {{key press|right-click|drag}} or {{key press|middle-click|drag}}
| style="padding: 5px;" | Translate in the XY-plane.
|-
| style="padding: 5px;" | {{key press|mouse-wheel}}
| style="padding: 5px;" | Move along the z-axis.
|-
| style="padding: 5px;" | {{key press|Cmd|mouse-wheel}} or {{key press|Shift|Ctrl|mouse-wheel}}
| style="padding: 5px;" | Zoom in and out.
|}


The following table shows the available navigation commands using keyboard shortcuts:
{| border="1" style="border-collapse:collapse;"
| style="padding: 5px;" | {{key press|X}}, {{key press|Y}}, {{key press|Z}}
| style="padding: 5px;" | Select keyboard rotation axis.
|-
| style="padding: 5px;" | {{key press|Left}}, {{key press|Right}}
| style="padding: 5px;" | Rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise around the choosen rotation axis.
|-
| style="padding: 5px;" | {{key press|Up}}, {{key press|Down}}
| style="padding: 5px;" | Zoom in or out.
|-
| style="padding: 5px;" | {{key press|,}}, {{key press|.}}
| style="padding: 5px;" | Move forward or backward along the Z-axis.
|-
| style="padding: 5px;" | {{key press|Shift|X}}
| style="padding: 5px;" | Rotate to the ZY-plane of the current source. (Look along the X-axis of the current source.)
|-
| style="padding: 5px;" | {{key press|Shift|Y}} or {{key press|Shift|A}}
| style="padding: 5px;" | Rotate to the XZ-plane of the current source. (Look along the Y-axis of the current source.)
|-
| style="padding: 5px;" | {{key press|Shift|Z}}
| style="padding: 5px;" | Rotate to the XY-plane of the current source. (Look along the Z-axis of the current source.)
|-
| style="padding: 5px;" | {{key press|[}} or {{key press|N}}
| style="padding: 5px;" | Move to previous timepoint.
|-
| style="padding: 5px;" | {{key press|]}} or {{key press|M}}
| style="padding: 5px;" | Move to next timepoint.
|}


For all navigation commands you can hold {{key press|Shift}} to rotate and browse
10x faster, or hold {{key press|Ctrl}} to rotate and browse
10x slower.
For example, {{key press|Left}} rotates by
1° clockwise, while {{key press|Shift|Left}} rotates by
10°, and {{key press|Ctrl|Left}} rotates by
0.1°.

=== Interpolation Mode ===
Using {{key press|I}} you can switch between nearest-neighbor and trilinear interpolation schemes.
The difference is clearly visible when you zoom in such that individual source pixels are visible.

Trilinear interpolation results in smoother images but is a bit more expensive computationally.
Nearest-neighbor is faster but looks more pixelated.

=== Displaying Multiple Sources ===
BigDataViewer datasets typically contain more than one source.
For a SPIM sequence one usually has multiple angles and possibly fused and deconvoled data on top.

Select ''Settings > Visibility & Grouping'' from the BigDataViewer menu to bring up a dialog to control source visibility.
