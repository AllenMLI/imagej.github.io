Image segmentation is "the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments." ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_segmentation Wikipedia])

It is typically used to locate ''objects'' and ''boundaries''.

More precisely, image segmentation is the process of ''assigning a label'' to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share certain visual characteristics.
