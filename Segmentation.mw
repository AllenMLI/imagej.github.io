= Introduction =

Image segmentation is "the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments." ([[wikipedia:Image segmentation|Wikipedia]])

[[File:Segmentation-overlay.jpg|link=]] [[File:Segmentation-boundaries.jpg|link=]]

It is typically used to locate ''objects'' and ''boundaries''.

More precisely, image segmentation is the process of ''assigning a label'' to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share certain visual characteristics.

One option which is designed to be very powerful, yet easy to use for non-experts in image processing:

Give it a tryâ€”you might like it!

= Flexible workflow =

One good workflow for segmentation in ImageJ is as follows:

#[[Segmentation#Preprocessing | Preprocess]] the given images
# Apply an [[Segmentation#Adjusting Threshold | Auto Threshold]]
# Create and manipulate a [[Segmentation#Creating Masks| mask]]
# [[Segmentation#Selections#Creating Selections | Create and transfer]] a selection from a mask to your original image
#[[Segmentation#Analysis| Analyze]] the resulting data

== Preprocessing==

Preprocess the image using filters, to make later thresholding more effective. Which filter(s) to use is highly dependent on your data, but some commonly useful filters include:
* [[:Category:Deconvolution|Deconvolution]]
* [http://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-29.html#sub:Subtract-Background... Subtract Background]
* [http://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-29.html#sub:Gaussian-Blur... Gaussian Blur]
* [http://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-29.html#sub:Find-Edges Find Edges]

==Adjusting Threshold==

[[Image: Threshold_tree.png|300px|thumb|Tree ring sample image with a threshold applied for a B&W image]]

Ideally you want to use one of the auto-threshold methods, rather than manually tweaking, so that your result is reproducible later on the same data, and on multiple other datasets.
*Open your image
*Select {{bc | Image | Adjust | Threshold...}}
*Specify whether or not the background should be dark or light
*Adjust the minimum and maximum sliders until you are satisfied with the saturation level of your image
**[http://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-28.html#sub:Threshold...%5BT%5D More information]

==Creating Masks==

[[Image:Eroded_tree.png|300px|thumb|Over-saturated mask is eroded around the center tree ring]]

*Select {{bc | Edit | Selection | Create Mask}}
*Based on the image and set threshold, some portions of the image may be over/under saturated
**Select the portion of the image that needs to be adjusted
**Select [http://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-29.html#sub:Dilate Dilate] to grow the included pixels to further saturate this portion of the image or [http://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-29.html#sub:Erode Erode] to remove saturation
***[http://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-29.html#infobox:InvertedLutMask More information].
*One quick way to split overlapping objects is the [http://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-29.html#sub:Watershed Watershed] command.

==Selections==
[[Image: Selection_tree.png|300px|thumb|Selections on the mask]]
===Creating Selections===
*Select {{bc | Edit | Selection | Create Selection}} to select the objects within the mask
*To deselect a portion of the image, select {{key|Shift}}+{{key|click}}
**[http://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-27.html#sub:Create-Selection More information]

[[Image: Reverted_tree.png|300px|thumb|Selections on the reverted image]]
===Transferring Selections===
*Before transferring the mask's selections, revert the image to its original form by selecting {{key|Shift}}+{{key|E}}
*Select first the mask, then the original image, and select {{key|Shift}}+{{key|E}} to transfer the mask's selections
**[http://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-27.html#infobox:TransferSelections More information]

==Analysis==
Do some numerical analysis on the selected data:
* [http://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-30.html#sub:Measure...%5Bm%5D Measure] the entire selection directly.
** Control which measurements are done using [http://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-30.html#sub:Set-Measurements... Set Measurements].
* Use [http://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-30.html#sub:Analyze-Particles... Analyze Particles] to extract desirable objects from your selection and report individual statistics on them.
* Use the [http://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-30.html#fig:The-ROI-Manager ROI Manager] to '''Add''' the selection and then '''Split''' it (under the '''More''' button), then use '''Multi Measure''' (also under '''More''') to report statistics on the objects.
* [[Macros_Intro|Write a macro]] to automate this sort of analysis, loop over objects in the ROI manager, measure and manipulate them, etc.
