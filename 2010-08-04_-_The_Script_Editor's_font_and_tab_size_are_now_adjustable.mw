Thanks to Yili Zhao, the [[Script Editor]] got menu entries in the ''Edit'' menu to adjust the font size and the tab width. The font size can be adjusted using the ''Ctrl+Minus'' and ''Ctrl+Plus'' keyboard shortcuts, too. As a goodie, the tab width is automatically adjusted to 4 spaces for Python scripts, for everything else it still defaults to 8 spaces.
