<includeonly>To reference Java classes {{#if:{{{lang|}}}|from {{{lang|}}}}} you will need to import them.
{{Warning | message = Unlike [[ImageJ 1.x]], [[ImageJ2]] (and therefore [[Fiji]]) does not automatically import any classes. Consequently, scripts written for [[ImageJ 1.x]] will not run in [[ImageJ2]] without adding the proper imports.}}</includeonly>
<noinclude>
This template is for use by the scripting language documentation, to explain that Java classes must be imported in order to use them in the script.

== Example ==

<pre>
{{ImportingClasses | lang = JavaScript}}
</pre>
{{ImportingClasses | lang = JavaScript}}
