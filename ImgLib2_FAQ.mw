= How to create a new Image from scratch? =

There are three parts to it: the data type, the dimension and the storage strategy. Example: If you already have an image ''first'' whose dimensions you want to copy, and the result should be of float type and be stored in a single large array, you can use this snippet of code:

<source lang="java">
ImageFactory<FloatType> factory = new ImageFactory<FloatType>(new FloatType(), new ArrayContainerFactory());
Image<FloatType> result = factory.createImage(first.getDimensions(), "result"); 
</source>
