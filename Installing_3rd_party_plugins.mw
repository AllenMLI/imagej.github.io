Please try to avoid closed-source plugins.

If you have the sources, copy them into src-plugins/.  (If you do not have the sources, copy the .jar into staged-plugins/.)

Then, add a .config file in staged-plugins/ and type "./Fake.sh".  The plugin will be compiled and installed into plugins/.

Longer version:

The .config file should look something like this:

        File, "Show Prime Numbers", Primes_("")

where "File" is the menu you want to add the item to -- at the moment, the
only valid choices are "Plugins", "Plugins><submenu>", "File>Import",
"File>Save", "Analyze>Tools", "Help>About" and "Edit>Options".

Next comes the title of the menu item, and lastly the class name of the
plugin with a parameter that will be passed to the run() method of that
class. It must a fully qualified java name (e.g. com.sun.java.something) 
if the plugin belongs to a java package.

In other words, the .config file will become the plugins.config of the
.jar file.

Please make sure that your .config file is designed such that the
menus fit in snuggly with the common Fiji menu structure.

Then just "make", and the plugin will be automatically installed.
