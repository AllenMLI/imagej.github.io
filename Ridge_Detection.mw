== Purpose ==
This plugin implements the ridge detection algorithm described in:

''Steger, C., 1998. An unbiased detector of curvilinear structures. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 20(2), pp.113â€“125.''

== Examples ==
[[File:CNT_Ridge_Detection_Original.png]]      [[File:CNT_Ridge_Detection_Example.png]]

This example shows the application of the plugin on images of carbon nanotubes (Sigma = 1.5, Lower Threshold = 1.3, Higher Threshold = 7).

== Parameter Selection ==

There are three parameters which '''have to ''' be specified. These are the mandatory parameters. The optional parameters can be used to estimate the mandatory parameters [[File:Ridge Detection Parameters.png|150px|thumb]]

=Mandatory Parameters=

'''Sigma:''' Determined the sigma for the derivatives. It depends on the line width.

'''Lower Threshold:''' Line points smaller as this threshold are rejected

'''Upper Threshold:''' Line points larger as this threshold are accepted.

'''Darkline:''' (true/false) This parameter determines whether dark or bright lines are extracted.

=Optional parameters=

'''Line width:''' The ridge diameter in pixels.

'''High contrast:''' Highest grayscale value of the ridge.

'''Low contrast:'''  Lowest grayscale value of the ridge.

These optional parameters are used to estimate the mandatory parameters.

=Further options (true/false)=
'''Correct position:'''

'''Estimate width:''' If this option is selected the width of the ridges is also estimated.

'''Show junction points:''' If this option is selected the junctions points will be displayed.

'''Display results:''' If this option is selected, all contours and junctions are filled into a results table.
