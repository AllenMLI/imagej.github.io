* Rewrite plugin to handle stacks correctly
* Rewrite plugin to handle 16-bit images natively


I think that this is superseeded by the Auto Threshold plugin which handles stack slices independently or with a global histogram (including Otsu's method).
There is, however no 16 bit version yet.

Agree. Like for the MultiThresholder, it should be removed with next relase
