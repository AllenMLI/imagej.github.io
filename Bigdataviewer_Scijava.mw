As announced in the forum [https://forum.image.sc/t/getting-bigdataviewer-instance-in-an-imagej-command/21110/8 here] and [https://forum.image.sc/t/fiji-commands-for-bigdataviewer/25601 here], this repository aims at a better integration of BigDataViewer into FIJI by using the Scijava Framework.

== Goals ==
* '''Modularity for bigdataviewer!''' Being able to combine scripts or code for display and processing. This update site creates a way to access an existing BDV instance when scripting or writing java code.
* '''Provide a set of macro recordable commands for bigdataviewer'''. Makes it possible to script basic actions on BigDataViewer with the IJ1 recorder.

== Installation ==
Enable the update site (link TO BE DONE) to activate bigdataviewer_scijava commands. All commands from this update site are present in the repository [https://github.com/BIOP/bigdataviewer_scijava bigdataviewer_scijava].

== What you can do with this update site ==
By using Scijava framework to store BigDataViewer windows through its <code>BdvHandle</code> interface, it is possible to communicate bdv instances between scripts and commands (see [https://imagej.net/Script_Parameters script parameter page]). This also facilitates the use of FIJI GUI because the commands of this repository can be chained  easily. Any script or Command which declares a <code>BdvHandle</code> parameter can retrieve or provide reference to existing BigDataViewer instances.

In practice, Bdv windows created via the commands from this update site  are put by default in the <code>ObjectService</code>. To get a reference to these windows:

* In groovy, add this at the beginning of your script
<source lang="python">
#@bdv.util.BdvHandle bdvh
</source>

* In Java:
<source lang="java">
@Parameter
BdvHandle bdvh;
</source>

== How to make your bigdataviewer workflow compatible with Scijava ==
Two options:
* Use the command <code>BdvWindowCreate</code> from this repository and retrieve its reference through SciJava parameter annotation. This will make your Bdv Window accessible to other plugins / commands.
* Create your own Bdv window, but declare the associated <code>BdvHandle</code> as an output of your Command:
** in Java: <code> @Parameter(type = ItemIO.OUTPUT); BdvHandle bdvh_out;</code>
The type of the parameter annotation can also be <code>ItemIO.BOTH</code> if your command is modifying an existing <code>BdvHandle</code>

== Secondary Goals ==
This repo provide an implementation of all the command from the repository bigdataviewer_fiji to make it scijava compatible, so it should have the same commands.

* Because complex bdv dataset (metadata, multiple views, channels...) are usually organized into <code>SpimData</code> objects, this update site / repository also provide tools to manipulate these objects, in a scijava compatible manner. Hence declaring in groovy <code>#@mpicbg.spim.data.generic.AbstractSpimData sd</code> or in java <code>@Parameter AbstractSpimData  asd;</code> allows to manipulate and communicate such objects.
* Easy visualization of the bdv sources present in a Bdv Window (-> access to display options). Right clicking on selected source also enables to access basic display operations.
* Easy edition with "standard actions" on bdv sources held within a Bdv Handle:
** transform 
** registration
** export
** import

== Examples ==
=== Video ===
==== 1 - Simple ====
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-q5qIdH9Idw (1 minute)
* Open a sample image. 
* Change display settings. 
* Double clicking on the source in the bdv window translate the window to the origin of the source

==== 2 - IJ Script example ====
https://youtu.be/IjIW5bOn4P8 (3 minutes)
* Create Bdv Window
* Start IJ1 recorder
* Open a voronoi image
* Create an affine transform
* Transform source with affine transform
* Make a loop and execute it
* Modify display settings

==== 3 -  Procedural + Warping + Export (xml hdf5 and ImagePlus) ====
https://youtu.be/uOYWn7tUsf0 (7 minutes)
* Open a procedural image ( mandelbrot )
* Create new Bdv Window
* Open voronoi in this new window
* Warp one into another using BigWarp
* Create a new bdv window
* Transfer initial Voronoi Image into this window
* Transfer transformed fractal into this window
* Resample transformed Mandelbrot like Voronoi
* Save initial voronoi and transformed resampled mandelbrot into a new dataset
* Close everything
* Reopen saved dataset
* Apply correct display settings

Resampling is necessary because XML/Hdf5 do not allow to save procedural images.
