A [[Beanshell_Scripting|BeanShell]] script that performs Strahler analysis on topographic skeletons (2D/3D) through progressive pruning of terminal branches.

== Introduction == 
[[Image:StrahlerAnimation.gif|350px|thumb|right|Strahler Analysis by iterative tree simplification]]

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strahler_number Strahler numbering] is a numerical procedure that summarizes the branching complexity of a mathematical tree.

There are different approaches to classify a tree-like structure by its Horton-Strahler numbers. One is iterative tree simplification, a method that requires detecting all terminal branches and all the degree-one paths leading to them.

[[AnalyzeSkeleton]] is able to detect and prune terminal branches, which, in the case of radial arbors (i.e., structures that branch out in all directions: e.g., in the case of cells, neurons in dissociated cultures, Retinal Ganglion Cells, Chandelier neurons, etc.) is usually sufficient to provide satisfactory simplification of the structure. Thus, [https://github.com/tferr/Scripts/blob/master/Strahler_Analysis.bsh Strahler_Analysis.bsh] takes a grayscale image containing a single arbor, and calls [[AnalyzeSkeleton]] iteratively to retrieve Horton-Strahler counts from the [[Skeletonize3D|skeletonized centerlines]] of the structure (see the  [https://github.com/tferr/Scripts/blob/master/Strahler_Analysis.bsh source code] for details).

== Installation ==
Download [https://github.com/tferr/Scripts/blob/master/Strahler_Analysis.bsh Strahler_Analysis.bsh] and place it in the plugins/ folder using the ''Plugins>Install...'' command. 
If you are not using Fiji, the script should remind you to install [[AnalyzeSkeleton]] and [[Skeletonize3D]], if you have not done so.

== Usage ==
Once you get acquainted with [[Skeletonize3D]] and [[AnalyzeSkeleton]], the script parameters become self-explanatory. The following descriptions were taken from the script's built-in help:

;Max. number of iterations
:The maximum number of elimination steps to be used, i.e., the highest Strahler order ('"root node") to be considered. Note that the analysis will stop as soon as there is only one end-point/branch in the skeleton, which may happen before the specified cycle.

;Elimination of skeleton loops
:AnalyzeSkeleton is able to resolve closed loops in the skeleton. The available methods are described on the plugin [[AnalyzeSkeleton]].
 
;Original grayscale image
:The initial non-thinned image to be used for intensity-based elimination of closed loops. Requires at least two open images.

Hold down ''Alt'' while confirming the dialog prompt (or activate ''Debug mode'' in ''Edit>Options>Misc...'') to document individual pruning cycles.
