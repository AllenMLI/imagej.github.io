== Introduction ==

Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy (SPIM, [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/305/5686/1007 ''Science'', '''305'''(5686):1007-9]) allows ''in toto'' imaging of large specimens by acquiring image stacks from multiple angles. We developed an algorithm for registration of multi-angle SPIM acquisitions using fluorescent beads in rigid mounting medium as fiduciary markers. The beads are matched by invariant, local geometric point descriptors and their displacement is minimized for globally optimal, sample-independent registration. The matching is computed very efficiently using a variation of geometric hashing reducing the matching problem to logarithmic complexity; the computation of the registration for a time point on a single computer takes less time than it takes to acquire the images making it suitable for real-time use. The framework can also be applied to register time-points to each other thus providing optimal alignment of time series.

The developed bead-based registration framework is able to reconstruct long-term, time-lapse, multi-view acquisitions of developing samples with yet unattainable temporal and spatial resolution allowing new insights into the development of biological specimen.

== Overview of the SPIM bead-based registration plugin ==

'''''Please note:''''' ''the bead-based registration has been rewritten and now replaces the "old" plugin collection (Registration, Advanced Registration, MultiChannel Registration) which has been moved to the deprecated folder. For information regarding these outdated plugins please refer to this [[SPIM_Bead_Registration_(deprecated)|page]].''

The bead-registration plugins offers two registration options:

* Single-channel
* Multi-channel (same beads are visible in different channels)

The typical option is single-channel registration, even if you want to process a multi-channel acquisitions. You can apply the registration of one channel later to other channels in the [[multi-view fusion plugin]]. Multi-channel registration is only required if the '''same beads''' are visible in several channels. 

Both options work in the exactly same way and have very similar options. The additional options of multi-channel registration are explained in the last section.

'''''Important note:''' the output of the plugin are not images, but only registration matrices that serve as basis for either [[multi-view fusion plugin]] or the [[multi-view deconvolution plugin]].''
