== Scale bar ==
Scale bars should be present on all publications/presentation images/movies. It’s worth putting them in sooner rather than later. Choose a standard scale bar size for all your images if possible to avoid confusion.

=== Spatial calibration ===
The spatial calibration of an image can be found in ImageJ via the menu item “''Image/Properties''”. It can be manually (re)applied here also. The units ‘um” are automatically changed to “µm”.

Biorad PIC, Noran MOV and Zeiss LSM confocal image files (''Leica and Olympus?'') are internally calibrated – based on the zoom and objective magnification settings. Some experimental file formats are not calibrated (e.g. Perkin Elmer) and some “exported” image files (e.g. Zeiss zvi’s exported as TIFFs) lose their calibration information. This is sloppy programming on part of the microscope manufacturers.

If the files have no calibration, you need to acquire images of a stage micrometer ''with the same settings ''(camera binning, objective, confocal zoom and frame size etc.) as your experiment. The calibration can be applied using the “''Analyze/Set Scale''" (see below). The spatial calibration can be found (and set) in the “''Image/Properties''” dialog. Also look at the “''Microscope scale'' ” plugin which can be customized to apply spatial calibrations from a drop-down box of objectives (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/microscope-scale.html).

Many image processing functions can cause the spatial calibration to be lost. If the final image has lost its calibration, open the original file and access the spatial calibration via: “''Image/Properties''”. Copy these values to the “''Image/Properties''” of your final, processed image. Replacing the word “micron” with “um” will automatically convert to “µm”. 

The spatial calibration can be reapplied in three ways: manually via the “''Image/Properties''” dialog; via the “''Plugins/Spatial calibration/Copy Pixel Size'' ” plugin that applies pixel size of one image to a second image; or via the “''Plugins/Spatial calibration/Set scale” ''command. ''Set scale'' and ''Copy Pixel Size'' are both included in the MBF plugins.

==== “Copy-calibration”  ====

[[File:copy_pixel_size.png]]
# Re-open the original image with the calibration
# Run the “''Plugins/Spatial Calibration/Copy Pixel Size''” plugin. 
# In the “''from” ''drop-down box select the original image; in the “''to”'' box, select your processed image. 
# Click the OK button.
# Another dialog will open giving you the opportunity to enter a value by which the receiving image has been scaled.

====“Set Scale” ====
If you know the size of a feature (for instance, a previously applied scale bar) you can use this command to apply a calibration.

# Using the line selection tool, draw a ling along the length of the feature/scale bar. Do not choose "''Edit/Draw''" after adding the line.
# Run the menu command “''Plugins/Spatial calibration/Set scale''”
# Enter the dimensions of the object/scale bar in the “''known distance”'' box and set the units in the ''Unit of length'' box.
# Do not check ''Global'' unless you wish all your images to have this calibration! Click OK.

This simple plugin simply points to the native menu command “''Analyze/Set scale…”'' and is included here to keep the spatial calibration functions in one place.

=== Adding scale-bar  ===

Use the line ROI tool to draw a line of approximately the desired length and position.

Run the scale bar dialog via “''Plugins/Spatial calibration/Add Scale bar''”. Change the “''Width in ***''” value to something sensible i.e. 5, 10, 50 etc. Stick to something consistent. “''Height''” will determine how many pixels fat your bar will be.

You can also use the line ROI tool to draw a line of approximately the desired length and position. In this case, the length of the scale-bar will be the length of the line ROI, though you can still choose if you want the scale-bar in the position you've drawn it or a different position on the image.

If you’ve used the “Green” LUT, then the “white” (i.e. gray level 255) scale-bar will appear green. Convert the image from 8-bit color to RGB with “''Image/Type/RGB color''” before adding the scale bar to get a white scale-bar on a pseudocolored image.

Check the “''Label all slices''” box to add a scale-bar to the whole stack.

This plugin simply points to the native menu command “''Analyze/Tools/Scale bar…”.'' It is included here just to keep the spatial calibration functions in one place.

==  Text and lines ==
=== Issues with adding text ===
Adding text to single frame images should be done in CorelDRAW or some such application so the text does not become part of the image and can therefore be edited/moved/removed at any time. Adding text to an image/movie is irreversible so should not be done on raw data. Images can be copied to and pasted from the system clipboard between programs using the System Clipboard plugin (Plugin documentation found [http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/plugins/clipboard.html here])or by using the ''"Copy to System"'' and ''"Paste"'' options in the ''Edit'' menu. If you find the image is not pasting accurately, try using the receiving application’s “''Edit/Paste Special''” function and select “''Device independent bitmap''”.

Firstly, save your images before adding text. Many things can go wrong here and often cannot be corrected so it’s best to have a saved version ready to reopen.

Text color is set via the color picker button on the tool bar. Double-click on it to pull up the palette and select a color – usually black or white. 

Pseudocolored images should be converted to RGB ("''Image/Type/RGB color"'') prior to adding text. The text is “anti-aliased”. This means that instead of being completely white in color, some pixels on the curved edges of letters are averaged with neighboring pixels to be gray, giving a smoother appearance to the text.

The text looks better; however, it means that some of the text’s pixels are not gray-scale value 255 and so some LUTs will have them displayed as yellow/orange/green thereby loosing the nice smoothing effect of the antialiasing.

If you use the red or blue LUT then the text will appear red or blue even though you selected the text to be “white” via the color picker.

To avoid this, convert the pseudocolored image from its current format (i.e. ''8-bit color'') to an RGB image with “''Image/Type/RGB color''” before adding the text.

=== Adding Text/Line/Box  ===

Adding a box, line, or text to a single frame should be done in a package such as CorelDRAW, Adobe Illustrator, Deneba Canvas etc. However, there are times when lines and boxes are required, e.g. to reference an analyzed/sectioned region.

Drawing of lines/boxes is achieved by first ''selecting'' the desired line/box in the image with the line/rectangle ROI tool from the toolbar or defining the box via “''Plugins/Specify ROI…''” or "''Plugins/Specify Line''". The line/box can be resized here to the desired size/shape with the small square handles on the ROI. The line/box can then be stamped in to the image through "''Edit/Draw''" or shortcut "Ctrl+d". If you're drawing the ROI to a stack, you'll be asked if you want to process all of the slices. Choosing 'yes' will draw the ROI on every slice while choosing 'no' will result in the ROI only being added to the current frame. The color is determined by the color picker toolbar button and the width in pixels defined in “''Edit/Options/Line width''”. The line width must be determined before it is drawn on the image. 

Adding text is done by the toolbar’s text button. Click the toolbar, click the image, and write the desired text. The font size and style are both set by double clicking the toolbar-text button and the color is determined by the color picker toolbar button. Antialiasing can be turned on/off via the menu item “''Edit/Options/Fonts''” and unchecking the "Smooth" option (although this option does not affect the Stamper plugins which have antialiasing on permanently). The text is stamped in to the image through the same methods of drawing on a box or line (''Edit/Draw'' or "Ctrl+d").

It is possible to add a line, box, or text to each slice in a stack. After adding to a single slice and selecting "''Edit/Draw''", you will be asked if  you want to apply the selection to every slice. Keep in mind that there is no undo option for this operation.

Adding text to a stack is a slightly different process. You can draw a text box by following the same steps, but on a stack, keyboard shortcut "Ctrl+b" will overlay the text on the current slice, while shortcut "Ctrl+d" will draw the text on every slice of the stack.

=== Adding timestamps ===

1. Open the time stamper through "''Image/Stacks/Time Stamper2''". From here, you can specify the location, interval, format, and other properties of the time stamp.

[[File:time_stamper.png|166x237px]]

2. Alternatively, you can also draw a rectangular ROI at the location and approximate size of the desired counter. The text will, by default, be of the same height as the ROI and will be aligned to its left edge. Note that if the rectangle is drawn on the right side of the image, the text could be cut off on the right if the size is too large.

Remember: bigger text will typically look smoother and the timestamp will be easier to read. It may be worth changing it to a consistent value for all of your movies.

Also, bear in mind that the interval needn't be "time". The Time Stamper can also be used to add "z-axis depths" to z-stacks and "angle of rotation" to rotating volume movies (° = Alt+248; µ = Alt+230).

=== Adding event marker to movie ===
The “''Plugins/Movies/Event Stamper” ''plugin can be used to add text to a movie for a designated number of frames, e.g. “Agonist ON”. This is simply done by running the ''Event Stamper ''plugin setting the desired text in the “Text” box, enter start frame and end frame and click OK. The text size and location are taken from the current ROI and can be changed once the dialog is opened.
