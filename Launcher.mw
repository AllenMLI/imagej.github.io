The ImageJ/Fiji launcher is a native executable whose purpose is to start up a Java Virtual Machine and run ImageJ 1.x, Fiji or ImageJ2 in it.

Its source code lives on [https://github.com/imagej/imagej-launcher GitHub]. It is used in the [http://jenkins.imagej.net/job/ImageJ1-releases/ ImageJ 1.x releases], the [[Downloads|Fiji distribution]] as well as in [http://developer.imagej.net/about ImageJ2]. It is built by ImageJ2's [http://jenkins.imagej.net/job/ImageJ-launcher/ Jenkins server] (i.e. the server that builds and tests all of Fiji/ImageJ's source continuously).
