== Introduction ==

Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy (SPIM) allows ''in toto'' imaging of large specimens by acquiring image stacks from multiple angles. We developed an algorithm for registration of multi-angle SPIM acquisitions using fluorescent beads in rigid mounting medium as fiduciary markers. The beads are matched by invariant, local geometric point descriptors and their displacement is minimized for globally optimal, sample-independent registration. The matching is computed very efficiently using a variation of geometric hashing reducing the matching problem to logarithmic complexity; the computation of the registration for a time point on a single computer takes less time than it takes to acquire the images making it suitable for real-time use. The framework can also be applied to register time-points to each other thus providing optimal alignment of time series.

The developed bead-based registration framework is able to reconstruct long-term, time-lapse, multi-view acquisitions of developing samples with yet unattainable temporal and spatial resolution allowing new insights into the development of biological specimen.
