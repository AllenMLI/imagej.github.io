== Introduction ==

Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy (SPIM) allows ''in toto'' imaging of large specimens by acquiring image stacks from multiple angles. We developed an algorithm for registration of multi-angle SPIM acquisitions using fluorescent beads in rigid mounting medium as fiduciary markers. The beads are matched by invariant, local geometric point descriptors and their displacement is minimized for globally optimal, sample-independent registration. The matching is computed very efficiently using a variation of geometric hashing reducing the matching problem to logarithmic complexity; the computation of the registration for a time point on a single computer takes less time than it takes to acquire the images making it suitable for real-time use. The framework can also be applied to register time-points to each other thus providing optimal alignment of time series.

The developed bead-based registration framework is able to reconstruct long-term, time-lapse, multi-view acquisitions of developing samples with yet unattainable temporal and spatial resolution allowing new insights into the development of biological specimen.

== Overview of the SPIM Registration Plugin ==

The SPIM Registration plugin reconstructs an image from several input images, called views. For this reconstruction process some parameters defining the input and output data are required. The user has to define how the naming convention of the input images, an approximate bead-brightness as well as the strategies for creating the fused output image. As the output images are typically very big it is strongly recommended to define a cropping are where the imaged sample is positioned in the output image. As this is not possible in the first run, there is an option to first create a down-sampled version of the output image, then extract the cropping area and by loading the previous registration parameters create the cropped full-resolution output image.

There are two plugins which take those input parameters in different formats:

* '''[[SPIM Registration#Registration | SPIM Registration]]''': Allows the registration of SPIM data with a subset of necessary options presented in the graphical user interface
* '''[[SPIM Registration#Registration | Advanced SPIM Registration]]''': Registration of SPIM data using all possible options via loading a configuration file

* '''SPIM Data Directory''': Fill in the directory name that contains all the image files. You can either drag&drop the directory, browse for it or type the name directly.

* '''Time Points to process''': Define the timepoint(s) that should be processed. You can give single numbers (e.g. 18), enumerate (e.g. 1, 18, 19, 100), define ranges (e.g. 1-18) or combine all of them in any combination wanted (e.g. 1,2,10,20-50).

* '''Pattern of SPIM files''': Define the naming convention of the input files by explaining how the angle and the timepoint is encoded into the filename. For example the file names are named in following way <br>''spim_tl1_angle0.lsm'', ''spim_tl1_angle45.lsm'' ... ''spim_tl1_angle270.lsm''<br>''spim_tl2_angle0.lsm'', ... ''spim_tl2_angle270.lsm''<br>''spim_tl100_angle0.lsm'', ... ''spim_tl100_angle270.lsm''.<br> That means the pattern of the file names corresponds to '''spim_tl{t}_angle{a}.lsm''', where '''{t}''' is replaced with the current timepoint and '''{a}''' with the current angle. If the numbers contain leading zeros (e.g. 000, 045, 090, 135 instead of 0, 45, 90, 135), this can be encoded by simply adding more letters to the placeholder, in this case '''{aaa}'''.

* '''Angles to process''': Define the angles (at least 2) that should be processed (for each timepoint if applicable). You can enumerate angles (e.g. 0, 90, 180, 270), define ranges in steps (e.g. 0-270:45 which means use angle 0 to 270 in steps of 45, i.e. 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270) or combine all of them in any combination wanted (e.g. 0, 45, 180-270:45).

* '''Timelapse processing''': Checked if a timelapse processing should be performed. In this case the '''pre-registered''' timepoints are re-registered to one reference timepoint which results in an aligned time series.

* '''Reference Timepoint''': Define the reference timepoint for timelapse processing if timelapse processing above is checked.

* '''Load segmented beads''': If the registration of the time point is carried out more than once (either to define the correct cropping area or to perform timelapse processing) the initial segmentation of the beads can be loaded to speed up processing. Note: if '''Load registration''' is checked, '''Load segmented beads''' is implicitly checked as well.

* '''Bead Brightness''': Define the brightness of the used beads relative to the sample.
