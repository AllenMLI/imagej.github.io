From Wednesday, September 20, 2017 through Friday, September 28, 2017, {{Person|Dietzc}} of [https://www.knime.org KNIME] hosted ~20 developers at the [https://www.knime.com/contact KNIME Konstanz Regional Office] for a [[hackathon]] to develop the KNIME Image Processing extensions along with the underlying [[ImageJ Ops]] library, as well as other related and/or supporting technologies such as [http://ilastik.org/ Ilastik], [[ImgLib2]] and [[BigDataViewer]].

There was a big focus this time on machine learning, particularly deep learning networks applied to biological data.

== Hackathon progress ==

=== Curtis Rueden ===

* Worked with {{Person|Stelfrich}} on automating releases of [[Architecture#Definitions|SciJava components]] via [[Travis CI]] ([https://github.com/scijava/scijava-scripts/compare/0235621...f5965c3 1], {{GitHub | org=scijava | repo=pom-scijava-base | commit=869206b008592b6849731fe5050817f888ae8a14 | label=2}}, {{GitHub | org=scijvaa | repo=pom-scijava-base | commit=7ec8e5fbabe0d64350cc6b6de92861a3cd89b828 | label=3}}).
* Assisted {{Person|Stelfrich}} in improvements to the <code>imagej-maven-plugin</code> ({{GitHub | org=imagej | repo=imagej-maven-plugin | pr=24 | label=1}})
* Reviewed and merged {{Person|maarzt}}'s initial revamp of the SciJava log framework ({{GitHub | org=scijava | repo=scijava-common | pr=272 | label=1}}, {{GitHub | org=scijava | repo=scijava-ui-swing | pr=25 | label=2}}).
* Reviewed and merged {{Person | Eglinger}}'s work adding a SciJava widget for <code>File[]</code> inputs ({{GitHub | org=scijava | repo=scijava-common | pr=286 | label=1}}, {{GitHub | org=scijava | repo=scijava-ui-swing | pr=27 | label=2}}, {{GitHub | org=imagej | repo=imagej-legacy | pr=165 | label=3}}).
* With {{Person|Eglinger}}, began work on several related SciJava scripting enhancements ([https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/issues/261#issuecomment-331487719 1]).
* Helped {{Person|HedgehogCode}} and {{Person|frauzufall}} with ImageJ/TensorFlow integration and API improvements (PR(s) to <code>imagej/imagej-tensorflow</code> forthcoming).
* With {{Person|Dietzc}}, continued work on the next-generation SciJava Struct API, including an overhauled widget framework and Swing widget implementations (as of this writing, on an unstable branch of <code>scijava/scijava-ops</code> repository; see [https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/issues/42#issuecomment-332658377 here] for a written update with illustration of progress).
* Helped {{Person|chaubold}} set up his {{GitHub | org=ilastik | repo=ilastik4ij | label=shiny new Ilastik-ImageJ integration}} with [[Travis CI]] and deploy it to the ImageJ Maven repository.

=== Florian Jug ===

* Worked on a KNIME workflow that starts IsoNet-type deep nets on a image column. Works well now, but we want to move tiled executions out from python and move it into KNIME (and also Fiji). This follow-up work will be performed by {{Person|frauzufall}} and {{Person|HedgehogCode}}.
* Received TGMM groin truth data an started working on Tr3d demo dataset.
* Started working on min cell-cycle constraints for Tr2d. This will make the ILP explode...
* Discussions with {{Person|ctrueden}}, {{Person|Stelfrich}} and {{Person|tpietzsch}} about ImageJ Conference details for 2018.

=== Tim-Oliver Buchholz ===
* Worked on the [https://github.com/knime-ip/knip-bdv Big Data Viewer GUI].
* Helped {{Person|maarzt}} and {{Person|xulman}} with KNIME Image Processing Node development.
* Fixed <code>DefaultDifferenceVariance</code> feature of the Haralick feature-set in <code>imagej-ops</code> ({{GitHub | org=imagej | repo=imagej-ops | pr=523 | label=1}}).

=== Benjamin Wilhelm ===

* Worked on CSBDeep Fiji Plugin.
* Added Overlap to TiledView [https://github.com/imglib/imglib2/pull/179 PR] in imglib2.
* Worked on API improvements in <code>imagej/imagej-tensorflow</code> with the help of {{Person|ctrueden}}.
* Programmed KNIME Image Processing nodes which provied a loop over tiles of an image. See [https://github.com/knime-ip/knip/commits/tiling-nodes branch on GitHub].

== Technical discussions ==

* Fiji component and application releases: today and in the future ({{Person|ctrueden}}, {{Person|fjug}}, {{Person|tpietzsch}})
** Next stable release (December 2017) will still follow the 'old' way of doing things.
** In case the DFG grant comes in and we hired the 2 people they will start implementing the new way of cutting stable releases. This will be great!
* How to integrate ImageJ, KNIME and machine learning frameworks (particularly Keras and TensorFlow)
