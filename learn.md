ImageJ is an open source image processing program for multidimensional image data with a focus on scientific imaging.

Fiji Is Just ImageJâ€”a "batteries-included" distribution of ImageJ which includes many useful plugins contributed by the community.

ImageJ's extensibility is the root of its effectiveness: many advanced image-processing methods are not provided by the core application, but rather are plugins written by specialists in specific fields, made available via update sites.
