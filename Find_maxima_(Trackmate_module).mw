== Purpose ==
This plugin implements the find maxima detection algorithm for TrackMate. It was tried to resample the approach as for the ''Process -> Find Maxima...'' command. 
The results are almost the same.

==Installation==
Copy the jar file into your fiji plugins folder. If you start TrackMate it is detected automatically and you can choose it as detector.

==Parameters==

'''Estimated blob diameter:''' To achieve subpixel accuracy this region is used for refining the positions.

'''Tolerance:''' As for the ''Process -> Find Maxima...'' command: "Maxima are ignored if they do not stand out from the surroundings by more than this value. In other words, a threshold is set at the maximum value minus noise tolerance and the contiguous area around the maximum above the threshold is analyzed. For accepting a maximum, this area must not contain any point with a value higher than the maximum. Only one maximum within this area is accepted."

==Example==
The example shows a typical image of scattering nanoparticles. The detection was done with a '''estimated blob diameter''' of 10 and '''tolerance''' of 10:
