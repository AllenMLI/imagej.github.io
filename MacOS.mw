It is [https://www.netmarketshare.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx the second most common desktop computing platform] after [[Windows]].

== ImageJ becomes very slow after running for a while ==
There are several reasons ImageJ can run slowly on macOS.

=== Java painting bug ===
On OS X, older versions of Java 8 (prior to 1.8.0_45)—as well as all versions of Java 7 (including 1.7.0_80)—are extremely slow at displaying images. You should either upgrade to the latest version of Java 8, or revert to Java 6 (see "Frequently Asked Questions" below).

=== Window menu bar bug ===
There is a bug in Java 8 on MacOS which causes the application to drastically slow down as many windows are opened and closed over time. Make sure you are using the latest version of Java 8, as well as the latest version of ImageJ.

=== App Nap ===
On recent versions of OS X—10.9 "Mavericks" and later—there is an "App Nap" feature which dramatically slows down applications that are not in the foreground. Leave ImageJ in the foreground while it is processing to avoid this issue. (There are also [http://osxdaily.com/2014/05/13/disable-app-nap-mac-os-x/ various] [http://www.cultofmac.com/274396/disable-app-nap-specific-apps-os-x-tips/ ways] to disable App Nap on your machine, but we have not had much success with them. If you find a solution that works, allowing ImageJ to run fast in the background, please [http://forum.imagej.net/ tell us on the forum]!)

== How do I run ImageJ with Java 6? ==

''Note: It should no longer be necessary to reinstall Java 6 on macOS. ImageJ should work fine with Java 8.''

Newer versions of macOS come without Java installed. However, users can reinstall Apple's Java 6 on macOS by [http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572 following these instructions].

Alternately, if you are a developer looking to install the Java 6 Development Kit, you must log in to [https://developer.apple.com/downloads/ Apple Developer downloads] with your Apple ID, search for "java for os x" and download the latest package ("Java for OS X 2013-005 Developer Package" at the time of this writing).

At any time, you can verify which Javas are installed on your system using {{GitHub|org=ctrueden|repo=ctr-scripts|path=java-info|label=this script}}.

Note however that, per [[#On OS X|the limitations]] of <code>--java-home</code>, you will have to jump through some hoops in order to run ImageJ with Java 6 if you also have Java 7 and/or 8 installed.

== How do I run ImageJ on Yosemite? ==

Install the [http://java.com/ Java 8 JRE] or [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/ Java SE 8].

== How do I run ImageJ on El Capitan? ==

Unfortunately, El Capitan has some new java-related issues. If you upgraded to El Capitan and your Java 8 installation is not being detected properly:

# Try installing the [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html Java SE JDK].
# If that does not work, see [https://oliverdowling.com.au/2015/10/09/oracles-jre-8-on-mac-os-x-el-capitan/ this guide] for steps which could get things working again.
# Alternately, ImageJ still works on El Capitan with Java 6 (see above).
