== ImageJ becomes very slow after running for a while ==
On some versions of MacOS, this can happen due to MacOS's "App Nap" feature. See [http://osxdaily.com/2014/05/13/disable-app-nap-mac-os-x/ this article] for instructions on how to disable it.

Another reason ImageJ can become slow is due to bugs in Java 8 on MacOS, especially when many windows are opened and closed over time. Make sure you are using the latest version of Java 8, as well as the latest version of ImageJ.
