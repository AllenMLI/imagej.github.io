Stack Linear Contrast - multiplies images in stack by coefficient obtained by linear interpolation of the "first" and "last" coefficient. A simple tool for compensation of contrast decreasing with depth within thick sample.

Lipschitz 3D Filter - top hat - subtracts slowly varying background calculated as lower Lipschitz envelope from the image.

Preprocessing example:

Stack Linear Contrast with parameters "first"= 1 and "last"= 3.
Process>Filters>Gaussian blur 3D with " sigma"= 1.
Lipschitz 3D Filter with parameter "slope"= 2.
== Plugins for detection of fibres in 3D image. ==
Tensor Line 3D Filter - enhances white fibers of uniform width sparsely distributed on dark background.

Example: [https://imagej.net/_images/e/e8/Capillaries_adipose.zip Image of capillaries in adipose tissue].
Tensor Line 3D Filter with "sigma" set to 3.

Process>Filters>Gaussian blur 3D with ". sigma"= 1.

Vector Line 3D Filter - enhances white fibers of varying thickness. Crossection of the fibers need not be circular. Parameter "sigma" corresponds to the largest scale.

Example: [https://imagej.net/_images/e/e9/Capillaries_heart.zip Image of capillaries in embryonic heart].
Vector Line 3D Filter with parameters "sigma"= 4, "scale number"= 2.
