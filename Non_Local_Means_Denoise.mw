= Purpose =
This is an ImageJ Plugin for denosing images via the non-local-means algorithm descriped in

''Antoni Buades, Bartomeu Coll, and Jean-Michel Morel, Non-Local Means Denoising, Image Processing On Line, vol. 2011.'' 

including the changes proposed by 

''Darbon, J. et al., 2008. Fast nonlocal filtering applied to electron cryomicroscopy. In 2008 5th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro, Proceedings, ISBI. IEEE, pp. 1331â€“1334.''

It is numerically optimized and multithreaded. It works with all image types (RGB, 32 Bit, 16 Bit, 8 Bit).

This plugin was developed within the scope of a study work of Pascal Behnel and is maintained by Thorsten Wagner (Both are members of the Biomedical Imaging Group).
