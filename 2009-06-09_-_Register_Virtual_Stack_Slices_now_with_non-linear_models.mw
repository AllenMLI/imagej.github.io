===Register Virtual Stack Slices now with non-linear models===

The plugin [[Register Virtual Stack Slices]] has been updated to work with the new generic image transformation library by {{Person|Saalfeld}} and with [http://biocomp.cnb.uam.es/~iarganda/bUnwarpJ/ bUnwarpJ] by Ignacio Arganda. As a result, stack slices may be now registered using:

* Translation model
* Rigid model: rotation and translation
* Similarity model: rotation, translation and isometric scaling
* Affine model
* Elastic model: with splines, interfacing with bUnwarpJ
* Moving Least Squares model: allows maximal local deformation.
