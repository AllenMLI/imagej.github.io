* With {{Person|maarzt}}, began work on a <code>PlotService</code> for ImageJ2 ([https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ui-swing/compare/plot-service...maarzt:plot-service maarzt/imagej-ui-swing@plot-service]).
* Participated in technical discussions with various people, including a "big-picture" status update for ImageJ2 covering my [[User:Rueden#Primary_projects|primary priorities]]; see [[#Technical_discussions|Technical discussions]] section below.

=== Tobias Pietzsch ===
* With {{Person|JeanYvesTinevez}}, worked on Mastodon/TrackMate3, in particular the unified handling of adapter views onto the main tracking model.
* With {{Person|Saalfeld}}, worked towards integration of caching mechanisms into unified scijava/imglib2 cache; generalization of BigDataViewer cache.
* Added support in [https://github.com/scijava/ui-behaviour ui-behaviour] for triggering multiple behaviours in parallel.
* Documented [https://github.com/scijava/ui-behaviour ui-behaviour] configuration [https://github.com/scijava/ui-behaviour/wiki/InputTrigger-syntax syntax]
* Assisted with various BigDataViewer-related projects.

=== Patrick Winter ===
* Improvements to KNIME SLURM integration:
** Many bugfixes (specifically for the use of image processing workflows)
** Implemented status view for more detailed information about the state of running jobs
* Got KNIME SLURM integration to run with the MPI-CBG Dresden cluster
* Achieved significant speed ups by running parts of an image processing workflow on the cluster

=== JeanYvesTinevez ===
* With {{Person|Pietzsch}}, worked on Mastodon/TrackMate3, in particular view colouring by numerical features calculated on a model.
* With {{Person|Pietzsch}},extended the [[MaMuT]] so that it can be used for 2D over time properly.

=== Christian Dietz ===
* With Marcel Wiedenmann, worked on processing of very large images in ops
* With Tim-Oliver Buchholz, worked on BDV integration in KNIP

=== Klim Kolyvanov ===
* Implemented the non-rigid [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.250.5954&rep=rep1&type=pdf coherent point drift] algorithm using la4j. 
* Pushed forward the implementation of the [https://github.com/milkyklim/RadialSymmetryLocalization radial symmetry] plugin for ImageJ.
* Worked on tracking of C.elegans cells.

=== Carsten Haubold ===
* With {{Person|Pietzsch}}, added a loader for 5D ilastik HDF5 volumes for BigDataViewer
* Worked on a prototype for a tracking export plugin system within ilastik to talk to MaMuT

===Jonas Massa===
* implemented an ilastik HDF5 import/export plugin for Imagej ({{GitHub|org=Beinabih|repo=ilastik-Fiji-Plugin|label=Beinabih/ilastik-Fiji-Plugin}})

== Technical discussions ==

=== Programmers Anonymous ===
* Robert is addicted to ImageJ.
* Ulrik can only do snapshot releases.
* Florian is doing too much at once... at least he has a car! (Yes Klim, you can join...)

=== Stable releases of Fiji ===
* We agreed to cut a stable release of Fiji once every six months.
** {{Person|Jug}} will manage the releases, both socially and technically.
** {{Person|Haesleinhuepf}} will update the [[Updater]] to more clearly communicate the ramifications of updating.
** {{Person|Rueden}} will create Jenkins jobs for automating cutting of stable release candidates and releases.
* We agreed to continue pursuing the "melting pot" builds of Fiji and/or the SciJava universe, to better detect cross-component regressions and incompatibilities.
** {{Person|Rueden}} will research effective approaches for running the melting pot via CI.
** Core maintainers (esp. {{Person|Pietzsch}} and {{Person|Saalfeld}}) will run the melting pot manually to vet its usefulness and correctness.

=== 3D viewers in ImageJ and Fiji ===
* We discussed how best to proceed with the [[ThreeDViewer]], [[BigDataViewer]] et. al.
** All agree to be very grumpy if the discussion ever degrades back to a laundry list of desired features (before we actually finish the first iteration of the code)
** {{Person|Kharrington}}  will continue efforts to consolidate [[ThreeDViewer]] and [[BigDataViewer]] into a unified viewer
** {{Person|tibuch}} and {{Person|Dietzc}} will continue to develop UI components for BDV and KNIME using SciJava for use in the unified viewer
** {{Person|Kharrington}}, {{Person|tibuch}}, and {{Person|Dietzc}} will reconvene in the Spring for component integration
** {{Person|Pietzsch}} will continue to work his BDV magic
* Roughly the idea is (we previously discussed this at the 2016 summer Konsanz hackathon):
** 4 viewer panels (number of panels is convenience not hard coded): X-Y, Y-Z, X-Z, and 3D. Viewer panels have sliders for time and other dimensions
** Control panel with selection of attributes that can be synced between viewer panels, but can also be used for independent control of viewer panels
** BDV provides orthogonal views
** Viewer panels have overlays: minimaps, intensity, etc.
** ROI overlays can also be provided 
** Panels are just JPanels
** {{Person|Pietzsch}} says most of the backend has already been developed in BDV
** [[ThreeDViewer]] should reuse more of [[BigDataViewer]]'s UI components
** GUI tools/widgets will go into scijava-ui-swing
** {{Person|skalarproduktraum}} will continue to develop Scenery for the core 3D rendering functionality
