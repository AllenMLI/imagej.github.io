=Introduction=

Watershed [ref Soille] is a common tool to segment objects in an 2D and 3D images. It is relatively fast and can provides understandable and robust results which can be used for image analysis.

Creating a good segmentation however requires some expertise and can be time consuming. One has to determine the right threshold to stop the watershed. Meaningful local extrema have to be selected to initiate the algorithm. And once a result is obtained the segmentation has to be compared to the original data. That process can then be iterated till satisfying parameters are found. That procedure can be very time consuming if not provided with practicle tools, especially when image are large and a single watershed can take minutes.

The interactive Watershed plugin provides an interactive way to explore local minima (maxima) and threshold, updating the resulting watershed on the fly. This is possible by calculating the watershed only once at plugin initialization. Further when Threshold or maxima selection are updated this initial segmentation is reused to generate the new segmentation instantly. In order to ease quality assessment the results directly overlaid to the data.

The 2 following subsection gives additionnal details on watershed working principle and on the strategy used in the plugin for local maxima detection: H-Maxima


==Watershed principle==

If we interpret images as landscapes of hills and valleys, the watershed algorithm gradually flood the valleys starting from their lowest point (the image local minima). When the floodings of two minima meet at a sadle they remain distinct as each minima region is labelled with a distinct value. The flooding is stopped when all the image is flooded. As objects do not always cover the whole image a threshold can be set to stop region evolution before the entire flooding. Alternatively the flooding can be started from local maxima. Figure 2 shows the flooding of 3 peaks for different values of the treshold parameter.

[[File:Figure_Watershed.PNG|center|800px]]
<div align="center">'''Figure 2''' illustrates the flooding of an image by the watershed algorithm. First row shows the flooding of a 2D image while the 2nd row illustrates the process in a 1D image (section along the red cut in the 1st row). 1st column shows the orginal image. 2nd column shows with spot the detection of local minima. Column 3,4,5 show the flooding of the image. If no stopping criteria is used the entire image is flooded (column 5).</div>

==H-Maxima amd H-Watershed==

An image local maximum (minimum) is a region in the image for which all neighboring pixels have a lower (higher) value. A lot of maxima in an image are simply caused by noise and are not meaningful. If one can select more significant maxima corresponding to objects, they could be used to initiate a watershed segmentation of these objects.

There exist many different ways of detecting local maxima. H-maxima focuses on maxima robustness. It has one parameter, H, that can be compared to the intensity of the noise in the image. H-maxima selects all maxima which are still maxima when their value is decreased by H. When H is increased, less maxima are selected but they end being more robust to noise. Figure 3 shows the maxima selected in a sample image for different H values.

We call H-Watershed the segmentation obtained by flooding the H-maxima of an image. Such segmentation has 2 parameters. The Threshold, T, that stops the flooding of the image and the H-maxima robustness, H, that defines the flooding initialization.

[[File:Figure_HMax_HWatershed_v3.PNG|center|800px]]
<div align="center">'''Figure 3''' illustrates the detection of H-Maxima in 2D, 1D and the resulting 2D watershed (repectively row 1, 2 and 3). The 1st column shows the original data, whereas column 2, 3 and 4 show the H-Maxima and H-Watershed respectively for H values 0, 10 and 40. The threshold value 100 was used for the H-Watershed on row 3. The image used for the illustration is a crop of the blobs image available from ImageJ sample images.</div>

=Usage=


==Installation==

To install the plugin in your ImageJ or Fiji installation. Add the update site SCF-MPI-CBG. Java8 update site should also be installed if it is not there yet. The procedure to follow an update site [[Following_an_update_site|can be found there]].

Once the update site is installed, restart ImageJ. A new menu, SCF, should appear. The Interactive Watershed plugin can be found in the menu ''SCF>Labelling>Interactive H_Watershed''.

==User Interface==

To use the Interactive Watershed plugin.

# Open an image to analyze. If the image has multiple channels or time points crop out a single channel/time point. the plugin focus on analyzing 2D and 3D images.
# In the menu ''SCF>Labelling'' click the item ''Interactive H_Watershed''. The plugin will be initialized with the image that is in focus. A full watershed of the image is then performed. If the image is large a process dialog will pop up indicating the remaining time. If necessary the process can be interrupted. In such case you can crop a smaller volume and restart. 
# 2 windows will popup after the initialization: the watershed image and the control panel. When the control panel modified the watershed image is instantly updated. When satisfied with the segmentation press the export button to create a label map image.

The control panel items, see Figure 4, can be used to modify the segmentation and its visualization. Their usage are described in the rest of the section:

* '''Analyzed image''': This is the name of the analyzed image. It is there for the user information
* '''Segmentation parameters''':
** '''Seed dynamics''': The slider allows to adjust the H-maxima selection. Increasing that value will merge regions, while decreasing it will split regions. Note that the value shown at the end of the line is not the actual <math>H</math> but <math>log(1+H)</math>. The reason is that logarithm scale provides a more intuitive interaction (many merging happen at low <math>H</math> but much fewer at large <math>H</math>.
** '''Intensity threshold''': The slider allows to select the watershed stopping criteria, <math>T</math>. Increasing <math>T</math> decreases regions size while decreasing <math>T</math> till they eventually disappear. Note that the value shown at the end of the line is not the actual <math>T</math> but <math>log(1+T)</math>. Logarithmic scale provides a more intuitive interaction as regions usually evolve fast for low <math>T</math> but much slower for larger <math>T</math>.
** '''Peak flooding''': this parameter is an alternative way to explore regions thresholds. Rather than using a global threshold one can apply distinct thresholds to each segment. Peak flooding allows to flood each peak till a certain percentage of its height. For the region <math>i</math> the threshold <math>T_i = T + \alpha/100 . (Imax_i-T)</math>, where <math>T</math> is the threshold parameter, <math>\alpha</math> is the peak flooding in percent and <math>Imax_i</math> is the maximum intensity in region <math>i</math>.  
* '''Display Parameters''':
** '''Display style''' decides how the current segmentation is displayed. The different modes are illustrated in Figure 5.
*** ''Image'' will show directly the label map of the segmentation. This mode is convenient to adjust the segmentation display control and look up table with imageJ usual tools.
*** ''Contour overlay'' mode overlays regions contours to a background image (by default the analyzed image). This mode is very convenient to check that the regions shape match object shape in the raw data.
*** ''Solid overlay'' mode overlays solid segment to the background image. 
** '''Slicing axis''': If the analyzed image is 3D the user can select the orientation of the result visualization. Selecting ''X'' will slice the data in the plane perpendicular to the X axis (the plane YZ). As the resolution of microscopy data is often lower in the Z dimension and might be the bottleneck for segmentation quality it is important to check segmentation quality in plane XZ and YZ. The choice of slicing axis is illustrated in figure 6. By default the result window show XY planes. Navigation through the planes is done with usual ImageJ controls (image slider, mouse wheel, arrows).
** '''View Image''' selects the background image (i.e. shown below the segmentation overlay). By default, it is the image that was segmented, but can also be set to any other image with the same dimension. Note that images can't be added to the list after plugin initialization. This feature is practical to compare region shape to the original data. For instance, if the segmentation was done on a filtered image that could have alter object shape (see figure 7).
* '''Export''': Once satisfied with the segmentation visible on screen the corresponding label map can be exported to an ImagePlus that can be further analyzed with ImageJ. The export action appear in the macro recorder for Image Macro Language and Jython language.

<div align="center">'''Figure 4''' shows the user interface of the Interactive Watershed plugin for 2D images (Left) and 3D images (Right). At the top of the panel, one can see the name of the analyzed image (Red). Below are parameters input, H value (Green), watershed threshold, T,(Blue) and peak Flooding (Orange). The control of segmentation display are: display style(Light purple) and the background image (Yellow). Finally the export button (Lilac) exports a label map corresponding to the current parameter H,T and peak flooding. User interface for 3D images also allows to select the slice orientation of the result window(Pink). Plane can be navigated directly with usual ImageJ controls.</div>

<div align="center">'''Figure 5''' is illustrating segmentation display modes. The second row shows a close up (red region from the first row). The raw data (1st column) are segmented by the Interactive Watershed plugin and can be displayed as a label map (2nd column),  regions contours overlay(column 3) and solid region overlay (column 4).</div>


[[File:Figure_IWS_sideViews_v2.PNG|center|800px]]
<div align="center">'''Figure 6:''' In 3D images a good assessment of segmentation requires to observe data in different orientation. Beside the usual XY view of the data (Left), the Interactive Watershed plugin can display YZ sections (Center panel, section along the red line) and XZ sections (Right panel, section along the green line). If the data are not istropic the views are resampled to remove distortion and make inspection effortless.</div>


[[File:Figure_IWS_customBgImage.PNG|center|800px]]
<div align="center">'''Figure 7''' illustrates the possibility to change the background image. When performing a segmentation on a filtered image (Left panel), One can select a background image (center panel, blue) different from the image processed (center panel, green), for instance to assess segmentation quality against raw data (Right Panel).</div>

==Scripting==

In ImageJ macro language one can perform a H-Watershed segmentation with the following command:

{{GitHubEmbed|org=mpicbg-scicomp|repo=Interactive-H-Watershed|path=scripts/macro_IJ1.ijm}}

In a Jython script the H-Watershed segmentation could be called as follows:

{{GitHubEmbed|org=mpicbg-scicomp|repo=Interactive-H-Watershed|path=scripts/jython_Ops.py}}

The run commands are also recorded by the macro recorder when exporting a label map.
