}}The [http://www.imagejfx.net/ ImageJFX] project aims to create a new user interface for the software ImageJ in order to ease scientific image analysis. While keeping the core components of ImageJ, ImageJFX brings scientists closer to their goal by making the interface clearer for beginners and more practical for advanced users.
