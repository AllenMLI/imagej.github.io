=== Cerebellar Climbing Fibers ===

We will go through loading in the CF_1 image stack from the [http://www.diademchallenge.org/cerebellar_climbing_fibers_readme.html Cerebellar Climbing Fibers] data set.  The raw data for this image is stored in RGB and about 3.4GB in size, so for convenience you may wish to load this as a virtual stack (i.e. one where the slices are loaded from disk as required), convert it to 8-bit and resave the file first.  In any case, I would recommend using a machine with 2GB of RAM (at the very least) to deal with these files.

To load the files as a virtual stack, go to "File > Import > Image Sequence ..." and select the first file in the sequence, "01.tif".  You will be presented with the import dialog, in which you should make sure that "Use virtual stack" is selected.

(Note that the number of slices in the directory (34) was automatically set.)  You should now be able to browse through the stack:

After loading this you need to convert this to 8-bit.  You can do this in any number of ways, and if you're actively working on a tracing task with this data you will probably want to do this in such a way that picks out tha brown coloured neuronal processes.  However, a simple way just for viewing purposes is to use the "Image > Color > RGB to Luminance" option.  This will produce results like this:

You can close the original virtual stack now.

It is a good idea to invert this image, since the 3D Viewer will make the low values of the image more transparent, and Simple Neurite Tracer assumes that neurons are brighter than their background.  So, go to "Edit > Invert" and select "Yes" in response to the question about whether to process all 34 images.  The results should look like this:

Before saving this out as a single 862MB stack, it is a good idea to correct the calibration of the image.  The [http://www.diademchallenge.org/cerebellar_climbing_fibers_readme.html data set web page] tells us that the separation between slices is 8.08 pixels.  So, if you bring up the "Image > Properties" dialog, then you can correct the voxel depth to be 8.08 times the pixel width:

Now save this as a single TIFF stack called CF_1.tif by going to "File > Save As > Tiff ...", saving it in the directory above the one with the slices, to avoid confusion.

You can now start the tracer with Plugins > Segmentation > Simple Neurite Tracer.  This may take some time, since there is a lot of data to load in to the 3D viewer.  The result should look like this:

You may wish to adjust the transparency in the 3D viewer by selecting the image volume (left click on the image in the 3D viewer) and then going to "Edit > Attributes > Change Transparency...":

Now, to load the traces click on "Load Traces / SWC File" and select CF_1.swc.  You will be presented with an options box like this:

Make sure that "Ignore calibration" is selected (as in that screenshot) and that there is no offset or scale set.  Once loaded you should be able to see the traces as here:
