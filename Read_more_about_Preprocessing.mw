== Pre-Processing ==
If the user chooses to upload the original movie, the program will process the movie internally by a flat
field correction and a median filter.
If the user chooses to pre-process the movie manually, they can do so in Fiji:
* Open movie and duplicate it by selecting {bc|Image|Duplicate|Duplicate Stack}.

* Apply a Gaussian blur on the duplicated movie by selecting {{bc| Process|Filters|Gaussian Blur}}.

The radius should be around a tenth or a twentieth of the size of the image. For example if the image is 512
by 512 pixels, the blur radius would be 25-50.
* Subtract the blurred movie from the original movie by selecting {{bc| Process|Image Calculator}}. In
this menu choose Image 1 (original) and Image 2 (blurred). The operation to be chosen in the menu
is "Subtract" and check the box "Create new window". This operation opens a new stack of flat
field corrected images.
* Finally, enhance the edges of the microtubules by applying a median filter. Select {{bc | Process| Filters | Median FIlter}} and enter the radius of 1 or 2 pixels.
* Save the pre-processed movie to be uploaded into the tracker.
