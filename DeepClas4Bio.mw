DeepClas4Bio is a project that aims to facilitate the interoperability of bioimaging tools with deep learning frameworks. In particular, DeepClas4Bio is an extensible API that provides a common access point for classification models of several deep learning frameworks. The source code and several examples of this project can be found in the [https://github.com/adines/DeepClas4Bio GitHub page of DeepClas4Bio]

DeepClas4BioIJ has been built on top of [https://imagej.net/SciJava_Common SciJava Common] using SciJava Commands.

Some ImageJ plugins to use this API have been developed and can be downloaded using the [http://sites.imagej.net/Adines/ ImageJ Update Site]
