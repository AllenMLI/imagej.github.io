<span style="font-size: smaller">Historical note: Shortly after the Max Planck Institute of molecular Cell Biology and Genetics (MPI-CBG) stopped supporting Fiji financially, the Fiji Wiki stopped being hosted at the MPI-CBG. The Fiji Wiki found a new home at the [http://loci.wisc.edu/ Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation (LOCI)] of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</span>

The Fiji Wiki is hosted at the [http://loci.wisc.edu/ Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation (LOCI)] of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Being a Wiki, edited by volunteers, the Fiji Wiki contents express the opinions and views of the respective authors, not of the website administrators nor the University Wisconsin-Madison.
