== Description ==

3D mathematical '''operations''' (erosion, dilatation, ...) are available in [[3D Filters]] using minimum and maximum filters. 

A 3D '''Fill Holes''' is available, works the same way as in 2D but will not fill holes if it is not closed in the Z dimension. 

A 3D '''Euclidean Distance Map''' (alos called ''EDT'') is available that takes into account the calibration of the image stack. A 3D normalized distance map (called Eroded Volume Fraction, or '''EVF''') is also available.

In the case of labelled objects (as count masks) a '''Binary Close Labels''' is available, that permits to performs closing on individual objects, hence avoiding objects to touch during dilatation operation.
