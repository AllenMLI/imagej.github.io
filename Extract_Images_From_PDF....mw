A dialog pops up to pick a file. Choose a .pdf file, and all its images will be opened as ImageJ images, in their original resolution.

If the PDF file is on the web, use a macro or script to call the plugin with the URL as argument:

  IJ.runPlugIn("io.Extract_Images_From_PDF", "http://www.example.org/slides.pdf")
