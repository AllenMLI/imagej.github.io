This plugin takes a sequence of image slices stored in a folder, and delivers a list of transformed image slices (with enlarged canvas) applying a list of transforms stored as '''.XML''' files in another folder.

This is a '''complementary plugin''' of [[Register Virtual Stack Slices]]. It allows reproducing the results of [[Register Virtual Stack Slices]] by loading the corresponding transform files (saved by checking the option [[Register_Virtual_Stack_Slices#Save_Transforms | "Save transforms"]] in the main dialog).

== User Manual ==
'''Premises''':

*'''Source folder''': You have a folder with an ordered list of image files in it that Fiji can open.
*Each image represents a slice in a sequence.
*'''Output folder''': You have or create a folder to store the resulting virtual stack with the transformed images. 
*'''Transform folder''': You have a folder with the transform files (from a [[Register Virtual Stack Slices]] execution).
*'''Interpolate''': Toggle the interpolation for the result images.

'''Step 1''': launch the "Plugins - Transform - Transform Virtual Stack Slices" plugin.

'''Step 2''': choose the source, output and transform folders:

*Select a source folder containing the slices, at one slice per image file.
*Select the target folder where resulting transformed slices will be automatically stored as TIFF files.
*Select the transform folder, where the .XML files from a [[Register Virtual Stack Slices]] are stored. 

'''Results''': on success, a virtual stack will open showing all the transformed images contained in the output folder. The virtual stack can be closed with no ill effect: images are saved in the output folder.
