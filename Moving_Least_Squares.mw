This plugin implements the algorithms described in <ref>{{cite journal|title=Image Deformation Using Moving Least Squares|author=Schaefer S.,  McPhail T., Warrent J.|journal=ACM Transactions on Graphics|volume=25|issue=3|month=July|year=2006|pages=533-540}}</ref> to deform an image given a set of landmarks.

== Tutorial ==
Load the original and choose the landmarks:

[[Image:MLS-orig.jpg]]

By clicking on the menu entry {{bc | Edit | Selection | Add to Manager}} add this landmark set to the ROI Manager:

[[Image:MLS-roi-manager.jpg]]

Duplicate the image ({{bc | Image | Duplicate...}}), click on the selection in the ROI manager and move the landmarks to their target location:

[[Image:MLS-new1.jpg]]

Now, run the plugin:

[[Image:MLS-dialog.jpg]]

And you get the result:

[[Image:MLS-new2.jpg]]
