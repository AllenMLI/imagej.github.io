== Overview of the multi-view fusion plugin ==

The multi-view deconvolution plugin is an image fusion plugin that computes one single image from several three-dimensional (3d) acquisitions (views) of the same specimen, taken in different orientations. The deconvolution tries to estimate the most probable image that best explains all views, given the individual point spread function (PSF) of each view. It can be computed for single timepoints or an entire timeseries.

==== Prerequisites I - Registration ====

Prerequisite for the fusion is an aligned dataset, an overview of the complete registration process can be found [[SPIM_Registration|here]], we suggest using the [[SPIM_Bead_Registration|Bead-based registration]] as it provides a simple pipeline.

==== Prerequisites II - PSF's ====

The multi-view deconvolution additionally requires estimates of the PSF for each view. They can be directly and automatically measured from the data itself if fluorescent beads were added to the volume around the sample and the [[SPIM_Bead_Registration|Bead-based registration]] was used to register the views.

Alternatively, an estimate or a simulated PSF can be provided as a 3d image. This is especially helpful in case the registration was achieved in any another way, for example using the [[Segmentation-based registration]] or by an external program.

==== Prerequisites III - Cropping Area ====

It is highly recommended that before starting the multi-view deconvolution, to use the [[Multi-View_Fusion|Multi-view fusion]] in order to determine the right bounding box for the image to be deconvolved.

''Note: Do not set the bounding box too close to the imaged sample as it might result in artifacts. A distance of around 30-50 pixels between sample and the bounding box is suggested for the multi-view deconvolution.''

== How to use the plugin ==

[[Image:Spim multiview dialog1.jpg|thumb|300px|Shows the first dialog that queries the location of the multi-view files]]

The multi-view deconvolution consists like the multi-view fusion of two consecutive dialogs. The first dialog queries the information necessary to analyze the dataset. Please note that all the parameters will be transferred from the [[Multi-View_Fusion|Multi-view fusion]] dialog that you used before to set the bounding box (cropping area).

We omit a detailed explanation of the parameters here as it is identical to the explanation provided [[Multi-View_Fusion#How_to_use_the_plugin|Multi-view fusion dialog]].

After providing the data the plugin will check which kind of registrations are available. Typically, the individual registration for each channel is available, and maybe also several timeseries registration with various reference timepoints. If no registration files could be found, the plugin will quit.

In the second dialog, you have to define the detailed instruction of how to run the multi-view deconvolution. The available options are:

* '''Registration for channel 0:''' You can choose which registration is used for this channel. You can typically choose between the individual registration of this timepoint or any registration to a reference timepoint.
