== Overview of the multi-view fusion plugin ==

The multi-view deconvolution plugin is an image fusion plugin that computes one single image from several three-dimensional (3d) acquisitions (views) of the same specimen, taken in different orientations. The deconvolution tries to estimate the most probable image that best explains all views, given the individual point spread function (PSF) of each view. It can be computed for single timepoints or an entire timeseries.

==== Prerequisites I - Registration ====

Prerequisite for the fusion is an aligned dataset, an overview of the complete registration process can be found [[SPIM_Registration|here]], we suggest using the [[SPIM_Bead_Registration|Bead-based registration]] as it provides a simple pipeline.

==== Prerequisites Steps II - PSF's ====

The multi-view deconvolution additionally requires estimates of the PSF for each view. They can be directly and automatically measured from the data itself if fluorescent beads were added to the volume around the sample and the [[SPIM_Bead_Registration|Bead-based registration]] was used to register the views.

Alternatively, an estimate or a simulated PSF can be provided as a 3d image. This is especially helpful in case the registration was achieved in any another way, for example using the [[Segmentation-based registration]] or by an external program.

==== Prerequisites Steps III - Cropping Area ====

It is highly recommended that before starting the multi-view deconvolution, to use the [[Multi-View_Fusion|Multi-view fusion]] in order to determine the right bounding box for the image to be deconvolved.

''Note: Do not set the bounding box too close to the imaged sample as it might result in artifacts. A distance of around 30-50 pixels between sample and the bounding box is suggested for the multi-view deconvolution.''
