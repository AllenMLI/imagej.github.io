In the '''right-click menu''' you can find various functions for manually arranging the views in your dataset under {{bc|Preprocessing|Arrange Views}}.

=== Manually translate views ===

Clicking '''Manually translate Views''' will bring up a new window that allows you to manually move the selected views along the x-, y- or z-axis using three sliders.

* If the BigDataViewer is open, the result of your translation will be previewed in real time (the views surrounding the views that you are moving will be displayed in ''gray'').
* You can select other views via the '''BigStitcher main window''' - if you have moved the currently selected views, you will be asked to discard or apply the current transformation.
* Clicking '''Close''' will close the transformation window - if you have moved the currently selected views, you will be asked to discard or apply the current transformation.
* Clicking '''Apply''' will apply the current translation and leave the ''transformation window'' open for further movement of views

{{Notice|The range of movement is limited, if you wish to move views by a large amount, you have to repeatedly apply a translation}}
