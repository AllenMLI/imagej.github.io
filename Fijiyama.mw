}}Fijiyama (Yet Another Matching and Alignment tool for Fiji) is a tool for registration and alignment of 3d images of the same object, acquired with different imaging tools (MRI, X-rays, Microscopy, Photography, ...) and/or at successive observation timepoints.

==Problem position==
3d images acquired with various imaging devices come with variable orientations and positions and can be hard to analyse. Similarly, when monitoring a tissue during long-lasting experiment, the sample cannot stay in the device during long-lasting monitoring experiment, and the object seems to "move" when switching from an observation time to another. In addition, as different modalities highlights different structures, these images can be very dissimilar. In this situation, structures and phenomenons cross-analysis in the different images can be untractable.

Fijiyama adress these issues helping you to register, align and combine 3d images in a common reference geometry. You can choose this geometry to align object axis with the image axis (X,Y,Z), to ease further visual analyses and figures construction. Once alignment is done, your images are not anymore a sparse set of informations, but a coherent multi-modal multi-time volume that you can explore easily with the ImageJ viewer, wearing different "glasses" (RX, MRI, ...) and changing observation time with one click.

==Contribution over existing tools==
As opposed to existing tools under ImageJ, Fijiyama is well-suited to numerous 3d imaging devices, including medical imaging (MRI / X-rays registration). It works also with more common laboratory images : microscopy, photograph. To adress the complex task of multi-modal registration, computation is based on Block-matching, an algorithm from the medical field. Other common algorithms are available in the plugin (Itk iconic registration). More about the algorithmic bases of the plugin ? See section "The maths behind", bottom of the page.

==Plugin features==

* Two images registration (training / settings mode)

* N-times / M-modalities 3d series registration (main feature)

* Composition of successives Itk transforms into a single transform

* Transformation of a 3d image (or a 4d / 5d hyperimage) with an Itk transform

===Video demonstration===

==Getting started with Fijiyama==
===Installation===
Add the plugin to your current Fiji distribution : 
* Manage dependancies : start the Fiji updater (Help/Update/Manage update sites...), and be sure the repositories ImageJ-Itk and ImageScience are activated.
* Install the plugin : download the [Fijiyama.jar Fijiyama plugin] into the "plugins" directory of your current Fiji. Restart Fiji, and look for Fijiyama in the plugins menu.

===Prepare your data===
In order to begin with the training mode, you need :
* Two 3d images of the same object. Use your own data, or the provided example dataset here [[File : Two_images_training_set]]
* A place to build an empty "Output" directory, that will be used to store the Fijiyama configuration file, the intermediate results (transforms) and the final results (transforms and images). The configuration file (*.fjm) keep a full track of your work. When you save the current registration experiment, the configuration stores successive registration steps and the associated computed files. When restarting later from this point, you can review the whole process, and eventually "undo" one or more actions.

===Training : two image registration===
Start Fijiyama from the "Plugins" menu of ImageJ. Click on "Two images registration", then follow the instructions to set the input images and the output directory. Once the registration manager opens, explore the manager, reading the "tooltips" pop-ups, the contextual help, and clicking the buttons and menus, until you feel comfortable to begin. 

The registration manager window has four parts (top to bottom):
* Black log window : a guide to remember last operations, and to understand what the plugin expect from you

* Settings menus and buttons : useful to set the parameters of the future action to run

* Action buttons : the first line (<b>Run</b>, <b>Undo</b>, <b>Abort</b>) drives the lifecycle of the selected action. <b>Save</b> can be used to "checkpoint" the experiment. <b>Export</b> is the end of the experiment : it produces the results as aligned image, according with the succession of transforms you compute. <b>Sos</b> can be pushed at any time and opens a help message, constituted of a fixed part, and a contextual part, depending on current configuration of the plugin. 
* Actions list : this list stores the past (or future) actions on the registration pathway

== The maths behind ==
Registration of two images is achieved estimating a geometrical transform that can be applied to an image (the "moving one"), to superimpose it with another image (the "reference" one).

The Itk iconic algorithm optimizes iteratively a transform, tracking the superposition improvement using a global similarity measure between the two images.
The Block-Matching algorithm (reference) is an hybrid method : it applies a similarity measure to compare subparts of images to identify correspondances. The correspondance are then used to compute a global transform.
