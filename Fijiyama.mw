}}Fijiyama (Yet Another Matching and Alignment tool for Fiji) is a tool for registration and alignment of 3d images of the same object, acquired with different imaging tools (MRI, X-rays, Microscopy, Photography, ...) and/or at successive observation timepoints.

==Problem position==
When acquired with various imaging devices, 3d images can be hard to compare : Images from various devices come with variable orientations and positions. The problem is the same when a tissue cannot stay in the device during long-lasting monitoring experiment. Finally, different modalities highlights different structures, and can make images very dissimilar. In this situation, structures and phenomenons cross-analysis in the different images can be untractable.  

To handle these issues, Fijiyama helps you to register, align and combine all these data under a common reference geometry, aligned with the image axis (X,Y,Z), improving further visual analyses and figures. As opposed to existing tools under ImageJ, Fijiyama is well-suited to medical images (MRI / X-rays registration), but work also with more common laboratory images : microscopy, photograph. 

Once alignment is done, your images are not anymore a sparse set of informations, but a coherent multi-modal multi-time volume that you can explore easily with the ImageJ viewer, wearing different "glasses" (RX, MRI, ...) and changing observation time with one click.

Alignment computation is based on Block-matching registration, an algorithm from the medical imaging world, developed to adress the complex task of multi-modal registration. Other algorithms are available in the plugin (Itk iconic registration). More about the algorithmic bases of the plugin ? See section "The maths behind", bottom of the page.

==Plugin features==

* Two images registration (training / settings mode)

* N-times / M-modalities 3d series registration (main feature)

* Composition of successives Itk transforms into a single transform

* Transformation of a 3d image (or a 4d / 5d hyperimage) with an Itk transform

===Video demonstration===
See the plugin in action in this video :

==Getting started with Fijiyama==
===Installation===
Add the plugin to your current Fiji distribution : start the Fiji updater (Help/Update/Manage update sites...), activate the repositories ImageJ-Itk and ImageScience, then add the Fijiyama repository, hosted on the ImageJ server (Blabla blabla lien)

===Prepare your data===
To begin with the training mode (or simply register two images), you can use the provided example dataset : blabla. To begin with your data, collect two images of the same object, seen with different imaging tools, or at different observation times. Set these two images in an identified and specific location of your computer. Prepare also an empty directory, that will be used to store your work : the step you did, intermediate results, and final results. This way, it will be easy to save the current registration experiment, leave the plugin, and restore the experiment state later.

===Training : two image registration===
Start the plugin using the blabla button, and check "Two images registration". Follow the instructions to define input data and output directory. Once the registration manager is started, try the buttons, and read the "tooltip" appearing, until you feel comfortable to begin. 

Explore the main elements of the registration manager :
* Black log window : this log window guides you, telling what has been done, and what can be done right now

* Settings menus and buttons : useful to set the parameters of the future action to run

* Action buttons : Run, undo, abort drive the lifecycle of the action you selected using the settings menus

* Actions list : this list stores the past (or future) actions on the registration pathway

== The maths behind ==
Registration of two images is achieved estimating a geometrical transform that can be applied to an image (the "moving one"), to superimpose it with another image (the "reference" one).
