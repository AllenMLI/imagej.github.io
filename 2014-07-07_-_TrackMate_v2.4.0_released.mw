We just released a new minor version of [[TrackMate]], that ships improvements to [[TrackScheme]] and bugfixes.


== Improvements ==

* TrackScheme now has an outline panel, useful to navigate in large models.

* TrackScheme has a better layout for tracks that have merge and split events.

* The 'Refresh' button on detector config panels is not present anymore. It's confusing and useless now that the quality value does not match pixel intensity at all.

* TrackMate has new logos and icons, made by Agnieszka Kawska @ [http://www.illuscientia.com/ IlluScientia].


== Bugfixes ==

* Fixed several problems with the 'Copy Overlay' action.

* Fixed a severe TrackScheme bug, happening when creating links with invisible tracks.

* Fixed a detector crash when running a preview detection with 0 spots found.
