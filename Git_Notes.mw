==Some things that I wouldn't remember otherwise==

This list is expected to be incomplete and even wrong, do not trust it!

;<source lang="bash">git init --shared=group</source>
:Tell the repository that it should always set the permissions to g+w.

;<source lang="bash">git init --bare --shared=group</source>
:Idem, but a bare repository (that is, no files checked out, so you can push to it.) This is meant for a remote server repository that all your coworkers push into and pull/fetch from.

;<source lang="bash">git branch -m <new branch name></source>
;Rename the current branch.

;<source lang="bash">git reset --hard HEAD^</source>
:Roll back.

;<source lang="bash">git reset --hard HEAD@{1}</source>
:Roll back.

;<source lang="bash">git checkout HEAD@{1} -- <file></source>
:Cherry pick.

;<source lang="bash">git diff <branch1> <branch2> -- <file></source>
:Diff a file between two branches.

;<source lang="bash">git log -p --color-words</source>
:Display a log with colored word diffs.  Say "-S" to less to virtually wrap long lines.

;<source lang="bash">git diff <commit a>:<file> <commit b>:<file> --color-words</source>
:Display a diff with colored words.  Say "-S" to less to virtually wrap long lines.

=How to create a shared remote repository?=

<dl><dt><source lang="bash">
ssh you@server
mkdir repos/remote.git
cd repos/remote.git
git --bare init --shared=group
logout

cd ~/local
git remote add origin ssh://you@server/home/you/remote.git
git push origin master
git config branch.master.remote origin
git config branch.master.merge refs/heads/master
</source>
<dd>Creates a bare remote repository at <code>ssh://server/home/you/remote.git</code> that tracks your local repository in <code>/home/you/local</code>.  Adopted from [[http://toolmantim.com/articles/setting_up_a_new_remote_git_repository Tim Lucas]].
