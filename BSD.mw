{{Licenses}}
'''BSD licenses''' are a family of '''permissive''' free software licenses, imposing minimal restrictions on the redistribution of covered software. This is in contrast to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft copyleft] licenses like the [[GPL]], which have reciprocity share-alike requirements. The original BSD license was used for its namesake, the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), a Unix-like operating system. The original version has since been revised and its descendants are more properly termed modified BSD licenses.

See the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses Wikipedia article on BSD licenses] for more information.
