== Purpose == 

Sets the thresholds for colocalization analysis, and also calculates Manders coefficients, 2D histogram / scatter plot, and other stats. 

== Documentation ==

<span style="color:red">Note: this plugin is now deprecated. You should use the newer [[Coloc 2]] plugin instead.</span>

See the great documentation for this plugin at [[Colocalization Analysis#Colocalization_Threshold]].
The method is that implemented in Costes et al. This uses a Pearson's correlation above and below the thresholds to iteratively find where the correlation between the two images is 0 and sets the thresholds there. It is pretty robust and importantly is reproducible and non subjective.

Use of this plugin should be followed by use of the [[Colocalization Test]] plugin, to see of the results are statistically significant and better then random overlap of the signal in the images.
