== Purpose == 

Sets the thresholds for colocalization analysis, and also calculates Manders coefficients, 2D histogram / scatter plot, and other stats. 

== Documentation ==

See the great documentation for this plugin at [http://www.macbiophotonics.ca/imagej/colour_analysis.htm#6.3%20Colocalisation%20Threshold MBF ImageJ manual page]
The method is that implemented in Costes et al. This uses a Pearson's correlation above and below the thresholds to iteratively find where the correlation between the two images is 0 and sets the thresholds there. It is pretty robust and importantly is reproducible and non subjective.

Use of this plugin should be followed by use of the [[Colocalization Test]] plugin, to see of the results are statistically significant and better then random overlap of the signal in the images.
