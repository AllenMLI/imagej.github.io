== Introduction & Overview ==

The '''Multiview Reconstruction''' software package enables users to ''register, fuse, deconvolve and view'' multiview microscopy images. The software is designed for lightsheet microscopy (see box for an overview), but is applicable to any form of three or higher dimensional imaging modalities like confocal timeseries or multicolor stacks.

Interactive viewing and annotation of the data is provided by integration with Tobias Pietzsch's [[BigDataViewer]]. Both projects share the same XML data model to describe the multiview datasets.

=== Examples ===

Below are YouTube videos of some examples that have been reconstructed using this software package.
