== Introduction & Overview ==

The '''Multiview Reconstruction''' software package enables users to ''register, fuse, deconvolve and view'' multiview microscopy images. The software is designed for lightsheet microscopy (see box for an overview), but is applicable to any form of three or higher dimensional images like confocal timeseries or multicolor stacks.
