== Introduction & Overview ==

The '''Multiview Reconstruction''' software package enables users to ''register, fuse, deconvolve and view'' multiview microscopy images. The software is designed for lightsheet microscopy (see box for an overview), but is applicable to any form of three or higher dimensional imaging modalities like confocal timeseries or multicolor stacks.

Interactive viewing and annotation of the data is provided by integration with Tobias Pietzsch's [[BigDataViewer]]. Both projects share the same XML data model to describe the multiview datasets.

=== Examples ===

Two examples of multiview datasets reconstructed with this software package are shown as YouTube videos below. Both datasets were registered using the bead-based registration ([http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v7/n6/full/nmeth0610-418.html ''Nature Methods'', '''7'''(6):418-419]) and the Multiview Deconvolution ([http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v11/n6/full/nmeth.2929.html ''Nature Methods'', '''11'''(6):645-648]), which are part of this software package. Please check out the Citation section for information on how to cite this software package.

The first video shows a developing ''Drosophila'' embryo expressing His-YFP in all cells. The entire embryogenesis was captured by lightsheet microscopy. The top row shows the multiview deconvolution of this seven-view dataset, the lower row the content-based fusion.

The second video shows a fixed ''C. elegans'' larvae in L1 stage expressing Lamin-GFP and stained with Hoechst. The four-view dataset was acquired using the Zeiss Lightsheet Z.1 microscope. It illustrates the increase in resolution that can be achieved through multiview imaging combined with multiview deconvolution. The top row shows one of the four input views, the bottom row the result of the multiview deconvolution.

== Detailed Tutorials ==

Using this software package consists of several steps. Please note that this software is more flexible and that this order is just a suggestion of how to use it in a more-or-less standard case.

== Downloading example dataset ==

There is a 7-angle SPIM dataset of ''Drosophila'' available for download [http://fly.mpi-cbg.de/preibisch/nm/HisYFP-SPIM.zip here]. Other datasets can be provided upon request.

== System requirements ==

Multi-view SPIM datasets are typically rather large, therefore it is recommended to use the registration plugin on a computer with a lot of RAM. The minimal requirement for the example dataset is '''at least 4Gb''' of memory however we recommend an '''16Gb+''' system, ideally at least '''64Gb''' and a CUDA capable graphics card. You may need to increase the Fiji memory limit by going to Edit->Options->Memory & Threads.
