SNT's Reconstruction Viewer is a powerful OpenGL 3D visualization tool for both surface meshes and reconstructions
* It can be used as a standalone program or from withing SNT
* Features:
** Advanced rendering supporting axes, transparency, color interpolation and path smoothing
** Interactive scenes (controlled rotations, panning, zoom, scaling, animation, "dark"/"light" mode)
** Tools for management and customization of scene elements
** Ability to render both local and remote files on the same scene
** Loading of surface meshes of several template brains (Drosophila and Allen CCF (Allen Mouse Brain Atlas))

=Starting the Viewer=
The Reconstruction Viewer may be used as either a standalone program or from within SNT. To open Reconstruction Viewer as a standalone program, go to {{bc|Plugins|NeuroAnatomy|Reconstruction Viewer}}. To open the program from within SNT, use the "Open Reconstruction Viewer" option in the 3D tab of the SNT dialog. If there are any tracings currently loaded in SNT, they will be displayed in Reconstruction Viewer after opening. Note that, for performance reasons, some Path Manager changes may need to be synchronized manually from RV controls.

=Scene Interaction=
[[Image:reconstruction-viewer-example-scene.png|right|thumb|400px|]]
The display canvas supports multiple modes of interaction, including controlled rotations, panning, zoom, scaling, animation, and alternation between "dark" and "light" modes.

*'''Panning'''  {{Key|Right-Click}} + {{Key|Drag}}
*'''Rotation''' {{Key|Left-Click}} + {{Key|Drag}} or Left/Right arrow keys
*'''Zoom'''     Scroll the mouse wheel or use the {{Key|+}}/{{Key|-}} keys
*'''Animation''' Double {{Key|Left-Click}}
*'''Snap to Top/Side View''' {{Key|Ctrl}} + {{key|Left-Click}}
*'''Toggle Axes''' {{Key|A}}
*'''Toggle Camera Mode''' {{key|C}}
*'''Toggle Dark Mode''' {{key|D}}
*'''Fit View to Visible Objects''' {{key|F}}
*'''Reset View''' {{key|R}}
*'''Snapshot''' {{key|S}}
*'''Help''' {{key|H}} (notification) or {{key|F1}} (list)

=RV Controls=
==Scene Controls==
[[Image:reconstruction-viewer-scene-controls.png|right|thumb|400px|]]
This menu provides control over the rendered scene.
*'''Fit to Visible Objects''' Computes a bounding box containing all objects of the scene and adjusts the zoom level to ensure all objects are within the camera view.
*'''Stretch-to-Fill''' Stretches the projection on the whole viewport.
<div align="left">
<ul> 
<li style="display:inline-block;"> [[Image:reconstruction-viewer-not-stretched.png|none|thumb|200px|Stretch-to-Fill - disabled]] </li>
<li style="display:inline-block;"> [[Image:reconstruction-viewer-stretched.png|none|thumb|200px|Stretch-to-Fill - enabled]] </li>
</ul>
</div>
*'''Impose Isotropic Scale''' Squares the aspect ratio of the selected dimensions, leaving the others unchanged.
<div align="left">
<ul> 
<li style="display:inline-block;"> [[Image:reconstruction-viewer-aspect-ratio-none.png|none|thumb|200px|Impose Isotropic Scale - None]] </li>
<li style="display:inline-block;"> [[Image:reconstruction-viewer-aspect-ratio-ZY.png|none|thumb|200px|Impose Isotropic Scale -ZY]] </li>
</ul>
</div>
*'''Reload Scene''' Resets the zoom level to the default, fitting and centering all scene objects into the camera view. The current rotation setting remains unchanged. Note if some drawables in the 3D scene are not being rendered properly when this option is selected, it will prompt to rebuild the scene completely.
*'''Rebuild Scene''' Clears all objects from the scene then rebuilds them from scratch. 
*'''Wipe Scene''' Removes all objects from the scene. Note this action cannot be undone.
*'''Sync Path Manager Changes''' If the 3D scene contains any trees that are currently stored in the Path Manager, re-render these trees to reflect any change in the path structure given by the Path Manager.

==Manage and Customize Neuronal Arbors==
This menu relates to the import, customization and management of rendered reconstructions.
[[Image:reconstruction-manage-arbors-menu.png|right|thumb|400px|]]
*'''Import File...''' Imports and renders a single reconstruction file (".swc" or ".traces"). A color may be chosen on import or applied later using the "Customize" sub-menu. Note that loaded files will not be listed in the Path Manager.
*'''Import Directory...''' Imports and renders all reconstruction files in a directory. A single color may be applied to all reconstructions or they may be colored uniquely. Note that loaded files will not be listed in the Path Manager.
*'''Load from Database''' Allows import and rendering of reconstruction files fetched from the FlyCircuit, MouseLight and NeuroMorpho remote databases.
*'''Customize''' A sub-menu containing color coding and rendering options for plotted reconstructions. 
**'''Assign Color...''' Assigns the chosen homogeneous color to all selected reconstructions.
**'''Color Coding (Individual Cells)...''' Applies morphometric color mapping to selected reconstructions. The chosen LUT is used to assign a metric-based color gradient to each reconstruction.
[[Image:reconstruction-viewer-color-mapping-individual.png|left|thumb|400px|]]
**'''Color Coding (Group of Cells)...''' Applies morphometric color coding to a selected group of reconstruction. Note that this option uses the chosen LUT to assign a homogeneous color to each reconstruction in the group based on the chosen metric.
[[Image:reconstruction-viewer-color-mapping-group.png|left|thumb|400px|]]
**'''Color Each Cell Uniquely''' Applies a unique and homogeneous color to each selected reconstruction. Note this option will override any previously applied color mapping to the selected reconstructions.
[[Image:reconstruction-viewer-color-mapping-unique.png|left|thumb|400px|]]
**'''Thickness...''' Specifies a constant thickness to be applied to the selected reconstructions. Note this value will only affect how Paths are displayed in the Reconstruction Viewer.
**'''Translate...''' Specifies a translation to be applied to the selected reconstructions. To avoid overwriting data from a tracing session, this command is only available in the standalone viewer.
*'''Remove Selected...''' Deletes the selected reconstructions from the scene.
*'''Remove All...''' Deletes all reconstructions from the scene.
