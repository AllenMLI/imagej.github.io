[http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/javawebstart/index.jsp Java WebStart] is a means to deploy full Java applications via web, without the need to install anything.

Fiji provides two WebStart versions:

* [http://fiji.sc/webstart/Fiji-stable.jnlp stable], which has the same versions of the plugins as the [[Fiji Updater]] would provide, and
* [http://fiji.sc/webstart/Fiji.jnlp current], which follows the cutting-edge of Fiji's [http://fiji.sc/fiji.git source code repository].

Both are updated every night (to be precise, some time after 04:15 central European time).
