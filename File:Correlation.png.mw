Match filter based on the correlation surface.  Starting from an approximate alignment (e.g. affine), for each vertex of the spring mesh, an offset is searched calculating the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient PMCC] coefficient ''r'' of a block at all possible ''x,y'' translations in a given local vicinity over the overlapping image.  The above windows display six examples of such correlation surfaces for translations in a square region with the origin in the middle.  The PMCC coefficnet ''r'' is grey-coded in the range from -0.7 to 0.7.  The candidate for the translational offset is the translation with maximal ''r''.  Candidates are rejected if either ''r'' was too low (not similar), there was more than one maximum with very similar ''r'' (ambiguous), the maximum is not well localized in both dimensions (an edge pattern that fits everywhere alongside the edge).
