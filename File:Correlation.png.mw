Match filter based on the correlation surface.  Starting from an approximate alignment (e.g. affine), for each vertex of the spring mesh, an offset is searched calculating the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient|PMCC] coefficient ''r'' of a block at all possible ''x,y'' translations in a given local vicinity.  The above windows display six examples of such correlation surfaces for translations in a square region.  The PMCC coefficnet ''r'' is grey-coded in the range from -0.7 to 0.7.
