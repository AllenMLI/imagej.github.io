This is a montaging plugin designed with submission to peer review journals in mind, however its versatility lends it to different applications. Peer review journals sometimes ask that your submitted figures uphold a certain ppi (pixels per inch), and to ensure that, you need to know the width of your image in both pixels and inches. Often collected images in a TEM or SEM do not save distance units in the metadata, and if they do the units are usually in nanometers or microns. This makes it hard to ensure your figures have the required ppi.

Since imageJ can set the image scale to any unit you want, this plugin sets it to a distance in inches designated by the user. It can also scale the resolution of your images. Together these two features set the ppi. It can also arrange multiple images into a single image montage, which is a nice way of showing different TEM and SEM images. It works with any file type that imageJ can read, and you can build pretty much any arrangement you want. In order to achieve a specific ppi, however, you must choose to save the montage as a file type that saves distance units in the metadata. Tagged image file format (.tiff) is a good choice.

== Directions ==
There are two objects upon which this plugin can operate: 
# A series of open images all containing the same size and aspect ratio.
# An image stack.

For example, the fly brain example stack that comes with the FIJI distribution of imageJ [''File => Open Samples => Fly Brian (1MB)''] is a pre-made stack consisting of 57 images that you can access to learn how to use this plugin.
