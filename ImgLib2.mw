ImgLib2 is a general-purpose, multidimensional image processing library.

It provides an interface-driven design that supports numeric and non-numeric data types (8-bit unsigned integer, 32-bit floating point, etc.) in an extensible way. It implements several data sources and sample organizations, including one single primitive array, one array per plane, N-dimensional array "cells" cached to and from disk on demand, and planes read on demand from disk.

== Source code ==

You can find the source [http://github.com/imagej/imglib on GitHub]. (Or [http://fiji.sc/imglib.git Fiji's server]; the repositories are [http://jenkins.imagej.net/view/Synchronizers/job/ImgLib-synchronizer/ synchronized].)

There is also a Jenkins continuous integration system that builds ImgLib [http://jenkins.imagej.net/job/ImgLib/ every time the code changes] as well as [http://jenkins.imagej.net/job/ImgLib-daily/ daily including Javadocs].

== ImgLib2 vs. ImgLib1 ==

[[ImgLib1_(deprecated)|ImgLib1]] is the previous incarnation of the library. We encourage
developers to use ImgLib2 instead, and [[How To Migrate Code From ImgLib To ImgLib2|migrate existing ImgLib1 programs to ImgLib2]] whenever possible.

For an explanation of how ImgLib2 has changed from ImgLib1, see the [[Changes from ImgLib1 to ImgLib2]] page.

See the [[How To Migrate Code From ImgLib To ImgLib2]] page for details on how to update your ImgLib1-based code to use ImgLib2.
