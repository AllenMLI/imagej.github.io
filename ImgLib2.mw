ImgLib2 is a general-purpose, multidimensional image processing library.

It provides an interface-driven design that supports numeric and non-numeric data types (8-bit unsigned integer, 32-bit floating point, etc.) in an extensible way. It implements several data sources and sample organizations, including one single primitive array, one array per plane, N-dimensional array "cells" cached to and from disk on demand, and planes read on demand from disk.

To get started right away, see the [[ImgLib2 Documentation|Quickstart into ImgLib2]]. You can find some additional examples on the [[ImgLib2 Examples]] page.

== ImgLib2 vs. ImgLib1 ==

[[ImgLib1_(deprecated)|ImgLib1]] is the previous incarnation of the library. We encourage
developers to use ImgLib2 instead, and migrate existing ImgLib1 programs
to ImgLib2 whenever possible.

For an explanation of how ImgLib2 has changed from ImgLib1, see the [[Changes from ImgLib1 to ImgLib2]] page.

See the [[How To Migrate Code From ImgLib To ImgLib2]] page for details on how to update your ImgLib1-based code to use ImgLib2.
