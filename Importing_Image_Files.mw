The File / Import submenu.

Most of the commands listed, particularly Fiji extensions, are also available (via HandleExtraFileTypes) simply by using the File / Open... menu item.

See also the [[Bio-Formats]] plugins.

*'''ImageJ built-in:'''
Fiji primarily uses TIFF as the image file format. The menu command ''File>Save'' will save in TIFF format. The menu command ''File>Open'' will open TIFF files and import a number of other common file formats (e.g. JPEG, GIF, BMP, PGM, PNG) as well as those detailed below. Files can be also dragged and dropped to the toolbar to open them
*''[[Bio-Formats]]'' Importer:
Many more file formats can be imported via Fiji plugins. One plugin is called Bio-Formats. This will import and export a wide number of file formats along with their important metadata. They can be accessed directly via the menu command ''File>Import>Bio-Formats'' or indirectly via the ''File>Open'' menu command which will use the Bio-Formats suite if it needs to. A full list of the supported file formats can be found on the following website: 
http://loci.wisc.edu/software/bio-formats
Drag and dropping an image file to the Fiji toolbar will prompt the Bio-Formats plugin to select the appropriate import function. You will be prompted with a dialog and your preferences remembered. These are self-explanatory.
Some image file formats are more akin to databases rather than images (e.g. Leica LIF files). In these cases a second dialog will list the images in the 'database' prompting you to select which to open.
There are three forms of Bio-Format you can use to import data into Fiji. One way is Bio-format remote. For this selection the image doesn’t have to be saved onto your computer or a disk. It is recommended to save it, and then use the regular Bio-Formats for the best quality image. Another Bio-Format option is called Bio-Formats windowless. With this option, Fiji uses the settings that were previously used for a Bio-Format image. So it skips all the dialog boxes at the beginning. The final option is the regular Bio-Format which you should select if you need to change the settings for importing an image.
*'''Zeiss LSM Panel:'''
The LSM panel plugin duplicates the Zeiss LSM file import function of the LOCI Bio-Format Importer, but will also extensively catalogue the LSM metadata. The ''[[LSM Toolbox]]'' is activated by the menu command ''File>Import>LSM.'' Once you select LSM the panel will appear.
Images are opened as 8-bit color images with the “no-palette” pseudo color from the LSM acquisition software. Each channel is imported as a separate image/stack. Lambda stacks are therefore imported as multiple images, not a single stack. They can be converted to a stack with the menu command: ''Image>Stacks>Images to stack.''
Once opened, the file information can be accessed and the information can be irreversibly stamped in to the images or exported to a text file. 
*'''Importing Noran SGI file:'''
Noran movies can be opened in several ways:
''File>Import>Noran movie'' opens the entire movie as an image stack. 
''File>Import>Noran Selection…'' allows you to specify a range of frames to be opened as a stack.
The Noran SGI plugins are not bundled with the Fiji package. To receive them, please contact ''tonyc@uhnresearch.ca'' or their author, Greg Joss, so he can keep track of users. Greg Joss ''gjoss@bio.mq.edu.au'' is in the Dept. of Biology, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia.
*'''Importing multiple files from folder:'''
Each time point of an experiment acquired with software such as Perkin Elmer’s UltraVIEW or Scion Image’s time lapse macro is saved by the acquisition software as a single TIF file. The experimental sequence can be imported to Fiji via the menu command ''File>Import>Image Sequence.''
Locate the directory, click on the first image in the sequence and OK all dialogs. (You may get a couple of error messages while Fiji tries to open any non-image files in the experimental directory.) The stack will “interleave” the multiple channels you recorded, and can be de-interleaved via ''Plugins>Stacks - Shuffling>Deinterleave''
Selected images that are not the same size can be imported as individual images windows using ''File/Import'' and select each individual image you want imported into Fiji. Then you can put those images into a stack by ''Image>Stacks>Images to stack'' Unlike the ''File>Import>Image Sequence'' function, the images don’t need to be the same dimensions. If memory is limited, stacks can be opened as Virtual-Stacks with most of the stack remaining on the disk until it is required.
*'''Importing Multi-RAW sequence from folder:'''
To form an image, Fiji needs to know the image dimensions, bit-depth, slice number per file and any extraneous information in the file format (offset and header size). All you really need to tell it is the image dimension in x and y. These values should be obtainable from the software in which the images were acquired. Armed with this information follow these steps:
1.       File/Import/Raw…
2.        Select experimental directory.
3.        Typical values for the dialog box are: 
Image type = 16-bit unsigned            (or 8 bit typically) 
Width and height as determined earlier
Offset = 0, number of image = 1, gap = 0, ‘white’ is zero = off
‘Little-endian byte order’ = on, ‘open all files in folder’ = on to open all files in folder.
Non-image files will also be opened and may appear as blank images and need deleting: ''Image>Stacks>Delete slice''. The stack will "interleave” the multiple channels you recorded, and can be de-interleaved via ''Plugins>Stacks - Shuffling>DeInterleave''. 
*'''Importing AVI and MOV files:'''
There are two plugins which can open uncompressed AVIs and some types of MOV file. AVIs can be opened via ''File>Import>AVI''
*'''Other Import functions:'''
Animated GIF- This plugin opens an animated GIF file as an RGB stack. Also opens single GIF images.
