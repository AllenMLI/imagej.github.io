This page explains a fairly simple way of generating code coverage statistics when testing Fiji using [http://emma.sourceforge.net/ EMMA], a Java code coverage tool which is [http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html free software].

To install EMMA, on Debian or Ubuntu you just do:
 libemma-java
... which installs the relevant jar file to <tt>/usr/share/java/emma.jar</tt>

The example I'm using here is to instrument VIB_.jar, since that's where the plugin I'm working on is compiled into.

First, I remove any old coverage data:
 $ cd ~/fiji/
 $ rm -rf coverage coverage.ec coverage.em
Then, make sure Fiji is built and up-to-date:
 $ make
(Quit the instance of Fiji that starts up.)

Now edit VIB_.jar to add code coverage instrumentation:
 $ java -cp /usr/share/java/emma.jar emma instr -m overwrite -cp plugins/VIB_.jar
 EMMA: processing instrumentation path ...
 EMMA: instrumentation path processed in 10913 ms
 EMMA: [726 class(es) instrumented, 72 resource(s) copied]
 EMMA: metadata merged into [/home/mark/fiji/coverage.em] {in 2218 ms}
That should create a file called <tt>coverage.em</tt>.  Start up Fiji as normal, except adding <tt>emma.jar</tt> to the class path, and run your tests:
 $ ./fiji --class-path /usr/share/java/emma.jar
When you exit Fiji after running your tests, this will have created a coverage.ec file as well:
 EMMA: runtime coverage data merged into [/home/mark/fiji/coverage.ec] {in 52 ms}
Now generate an HTML report of the coverage data with:
 $ java -cp /usr/share/java/emma.jar emma report -r html -sp VIB -in coverage.em -in coverage.ec
 EMMA: processing input files ...
 EMMA: 2 file(s) read and merged in 583 ms
 EMMA: writing [html] report to [/home/mark/fiji/coverage/index.html] ...
(The <tt>-sp VIB</tt> parameter says to use the VIB subdirectory as a source path - without this you won't be able to see the source code highlighted according to coverage.)  That command generates the report in a subdirectory called <tt>coverage</tt>, so view the report with, for example:
 $ firefox coverage/index.html
You should see a summary like the following:

... and can click through to line-by-line coverage of a source file, like this:
