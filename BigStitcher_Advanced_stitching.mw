= Overview =

In addition to the default Phase Correlation-based pairwise shift determination, we offer some alternative methods and advanced parameterization, as well as non-standard grouping of the views in your dataset.

If you want to proceed straight to the next steps after calculating the shifts, we offer the same options under {{bc|Stitching Wizard|Stitch dataset (expert) ...}}

= Advanced pairwise shift calculation =

We currently support three different ways of calculating pairwise shifts.

{{Notice|We strongly advice to try the default '''Phase Correlation''' first, as it tends to give the most robust results in comparison to the more specialized methods below.}}
