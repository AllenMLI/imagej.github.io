Modeling in SNT is performed through [https://github.com/morphonets/cx3d Cortex3D (Cx3D)] and [[SciView]]. Cx3D was developed in 2009<ref name="Zubler"></ref>  as a computational modeling tool for simulating neurodevelopmental processes and is well known for generative models of cortical circuits. More recently, Cx3D was modified by {{Person|Kharrington}} so that it could grow neuronal processes with [[SciView]]â€™s data structures.
