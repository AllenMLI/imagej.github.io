Modeling in SNT is performed through [https://github.com/morphonets/cx3d Cortex3D (Cx3D)] and [[SciView]]. Cx3D was developed in 2009<ref name="Zubler"></ref>  as a computational modeling tool for simulating neurodevelopmental processes and is well known for generative models of cortical circuits. 

The [http://morphonets.org Morphonets] distribution of Cx3D was modified by {{Person|Kharrington}} to be compatible with the ImageJ and Fiji ecosystem. This includes using [[SciView]] for 3D visualization, and support for image-based modeling.

Currently, an [[IDEs|IDE]] is the most effective way to implement custom models, using the [https://github.com/morphonets/minimal-cx3d-example-project minimal-cx3d-example-project] as a template. For more information refer to the [https://github.com/morphonets/cx3d GitHub project page].
