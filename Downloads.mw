The easiest way to fetch the source code for Fiji is to use [https://github.com/fiji/fiji git]. For further guidance on this, please refer to the page [[Downloading and Building Fiji From Source]].

=== Packages for Debian / Ubuntu ===

'''Please send any feedback about these packages to mark-fiji ''at'' longair.net would be very much appreciated.'''

There are Debian packages of Fiji.  If you want to use the latest version that we have tested and consider to be stable, add the following lines to /etc/apt/sources.list:

 <nowiki>deb http://fiji.sc/downloads/apt/ ./</nowiki>
 <nowiki>deb-src http://fiji.sc/downloads/apt/ ./</nowiki>

Then do the following:

 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install fiji

You should then be able to just run "fiji" from the command line.

==== Experimental Weekly Builds ====

There is also an unstable version of the Debian Fiji packages, which is automatically built every week.  The advantage of this version is that you will get updates to Fiji more frequently, while the disadvantages are that these packages are very large, and may not have been tested at all.  If you want to use these packages, instead add the following to `/etc/apt/sources.list`:

 <nowiki>deb http://fiji.sc/downloads/apt-experimental/ ./</nowiki>
 <nowiki>deb-src http://fiji.sc/downloads/apt-experimental/ ./</nowiki>

Then do:

 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install fiji

==== Known Bugs ====

* These packages should work for you, but fail to meet policy for being official Debian and Ubuntu packages in many ways - we are working towards this, however, so if you use the apt repository above and update regularly, you should see the packages improve and reduce in size over time.

* These packages aren't signed at the moment, so you will get a warning about the packages not being authenticated.
