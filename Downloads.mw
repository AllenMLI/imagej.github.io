{{Downloads}}

== Installation ==

Fiji comes as a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_application portable application]. That means that you do not have to install it; just download, unpack and start it.

For more detailed instructions, see the installation walkthroughs:
* [[Install Fiji on Windows]]
* [[Install Fiji on MacOSX]]
* [[Install Fiji on Linux]]

{{Warning
| message = <div style="font-size: large; color: red; padding-bottom: 10px">Caution: "<code>Program Files</code>" not recommended!</div>If you are installing Fiji on Windows, we strongly recommend that you store your Fiji.app directory somewhere in your user space (e.g., "<code>C:\Users\[your name]\Fiji.app</code>") rather than in "<code>C:\Program Files</code>" or other system-wide directory. If you move Fiji.app to such a directory, modern versions of Windows will deny Fiji write permission to its own directory structure, preventing it from being able to update.

== Source Code ==

The easiest way to fetch the source code for Fiji is to use [https://github.com/fiji/fiji git]. For further guidance on this, please refer to the page [[Downloading and Building Fiji From Source]].

== Packages for Debian / Ubuntu ==

We used to offer Debian packages. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, we are withdrawing support for these packages until such time as someone is able to maintain them properly, so please switch to using the Linux downloads above instead.

If you are a Debian packaging expert who would like to address this situation, we would love to have your helpâ€”please join us [http://fiji.sc/IRC in IRC] or contact the [http://groups.google.com/group/fiji-devel fiji-devel mailing list].
