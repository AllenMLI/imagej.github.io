'''Note:''' We are in '''-rc3''' phase now, that is, all downloads here are release candidates.

Please bear in mind: Fiji is ''alpha'' software for now.  If you want it to become stable, please consider submitting [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/bugzilla/ bug reports], or ask for help on [http://groups.google.com/group/fiji-users the mailing list], but be prepared to test our fixes, too :-)

You can download Fiji for

=== Packages for Debian / Ubuntu ===

There are some Debian packages of Fiji rc3 that you can try.  (These packages include the JRE.)  Add the following lines to /etc/apt/sources.list:

  deb http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/downloads/apt/ ./
  deb-src http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/downloads/apt/ ./

Then do the following:

  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install fiji

You should then be able to just run "fiji" from the command line.

Alternatively, if you want to install the .deb files directly with dpkg, you can download the packages directly here:

* [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/downloads/apt/binary-i386/fiji_0.9.2.20080807rc3_i386.deb Package for i386 (32 bit)]
* [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/downloads/apt/binary-amd64/fiji_0.9.2.20080807rc3_amd64.deb Package for amd64 (64 bit)]

(These packages should work for you, but fail to meet policy for being official Debian and Ubuntu packages in many ways - we are working towards this, however, so if you use the apt repository above and update regularly, you should see the packages improve and reduce in size over time.)
