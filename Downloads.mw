=== Source Code ===	 

The easiest way to fetch the source code for Fiji is to use [https://github.com/fiji/fiji git]. For further guidance on this, please refer to the page [[Downloading and Building Fiji From Source]].

=== Packages for Debian / Ubuntu ===

We used to offer Debian packages. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, we are withdrawing support for these packages until such time as someone is able to maintain them properly, so please switch to using the Linux downloads above instead.

If you are a Debian packaging expert who would like to address this situation, we would love to have your helpâ€”please join us [http://fiji.sc/IRC in IRC] or contact the [http://groups.google.com/group/fiji-devel fiji-devel mailing list].
