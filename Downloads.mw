<span style="color:red">'''Critical:'''</span> if you updated and Fiji does not work anymore, you need to follow [[Fix_non-functional_Fiji_after_Update|these instructions]].<br/>

If you encounter bugs, please consider submitting [http://fiji.sc/bugzilla/ bug reports], or ask for help on [http://groups.google.com/group/fiji-users the mailing list], but we might ask you to test our fixes, too :-)

<b>Please note! The authoritative site for Fiji is <i>http://fiji.sc/</i>, so if you downloaded Fiji from some mirrors such as Softpedia and experience problems, please re-download from here and verify that the problem still exists.</b>

=== Source Code ===	 
			
The easiest way to fetch the source code for Fiji is to use [http://git.or.cz/ git]. For further guidance on this, please refer to the page [[Downloading and Building Fiji From Source]].

=== Packages for Debian / Ubuntu ===

'''These packages have not been extensively tested, so feedback to mark-fiji ''at'' longair.net would be very much appreciated.'''

There are Debian packages of Fiji.  Add the following lines to /etc/apt/sources.list:

 <nowiki>deb http://fiji.sc/downloads/apt/ ./</nowiki>
 <nowiki>deb-src http://fiji.sc/downloads/apt/ ./</nowiki>

Then do the following:

 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install fiji

You should then be able to just run "fiji" from the command line.

==== Known Bugs ====

* These packages should work for you, but fail to meet policy for being official Debian and Ubuntu packages in many ways - we are working towards this, however, so if you use the apt repository above and update regularly, you should see the packages improve and reduce in size over time.

* These packages aren't signed at the moment, so you will get a warning about the packages not being authenticated.
