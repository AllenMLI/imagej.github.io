== System requirements ==

ImageJ will run on any system that has a Java 6 (or later) runtime installed. This includes, but is not limited to:

# Windows XP, Vista, 7 or 8 with Java installed from [http://java.com/ java.com]
# Mac OS X 10.5 "Leopard" with an Intel 64-bit processor with the Java 6 update
# Mac OS X 10.6 "Snow Leopard" (Java 6 is preinstalled)
# Mac OS X 10.7 "Lion" or later with Java installed from [http://java.com/ java.com]
# Ubuntu Linux with sun-java6-jre or openjdk-6-jre installed from the package manager

Please note that we currently test ImageJ mostly with Oracle Java 6. We have done a limited amount of testing with OpenJDK 7 and with Oracle Java 8, and things superficially work, but there may be additional bugs in those cases. Feel free to report any such issues to the [[Mailing Lists]].

{{Downloads}}

== Troubleshooting ==

* If you updated and ImageJ does not work anymore, you need to follow [[Fix_non-functional_ImageJ_after_Update|these instructions]].
* If you encounter bugs, there are many ways to get help; please see the [[Help:Contents|Getting Help]] page.

== Installation ==

ImageJ and Fiji are distributed as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_application portable applications]. That means that you do not have to run an installer; just download, unpack and start it.

See the [[source code]] page for details on obtaining the ImageJ and Fiji source code.

== Packages for Debian / Ubuntu ==

We used to offer Debian packages. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, we are withdrawing support for these packages until such time as someone is able to maintain them properly, so please switch to using the Linux downloads above instead.

If you are a Debian packaging expert who would like to address this situation, we would love to have your helpâ€”please join us [http://fiji.sc/IRC in IRC] or contact the [http://groups.google.com/group/fiji-devel fiji-devel mailing list].
