ImageJ will run on any system that has a Java 6 (or later) runtime installed. This includes, but is not limited to:

# Windows XP, Vista, 7 or 8 with Java installed from [http://java.com/ java.com]
# Mac OS X 10.5 "Leopard" with an Intel 64-bit processor with the Java 6 update
# Mac OS X 10.6 "Snow Leopard" (Java 6 is preinstalled)
# Mac OS X 10.7 "Lion" or later with Java installed from [http://java.com/ java.com]
# Ubuntu Linux with sun-java6-jre or openjdk-6-jre installed from the package manager

Please note that we currently test ImageJ mostly with Oracle Java 6. We have done a limited amount of testing with OpenJDK 7 and with Oracle Java 8, and things superficially work, but there may be additional bugs in those cases. Feel free to report any such issues to the [[Mailing Lists]].
