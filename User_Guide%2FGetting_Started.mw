This part provides basic information on ImageJ installation, troubleshooting and update strategies. It discusses [[#sub:Fiji-intro|Fiji↓]][[#nom-fiji|↓]] and [[#sub:ImageJ2intro|ImageJ2↓]] as well as third-party software related to ImageJ. Being impossible to document all the capabilities of ImageJ without exploring technical aspects of image processing, external resources allowing willing readers to know more about digital signal processing are also provided.

==Introduction==

<div class="Standard">

ImageJ is a [http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/disclaimer.html public domain] Java image processing and analysis program inspired by [http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/ NIH Image] for the Macintosh. It runs, either as an online applet or as a downloadable application, on any computer with a Java 1.5 or later virtual machine. [http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html Downloadable distributions] are available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. It can display, edit, analyze, process, save and print 8--bit, 16--bit and 32--bit images. It can read many image formats including TIFF, GIF, JPEG, BMP, DICOM, FITS and ‘raw’. It supports ‘stacks’ (and hyperstacks), a series of images that share a single window. It is multithreaded, so time-consuming operations such as image file reading can be performed in parallel with other operations<span class="FootOuter"><span class="SupFootMarker"> [A] </span><span class="HoverFoot"><span class="SupFootMarker"> [A] </span>A somehow outdated list of ImageJ’s features is available at http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/features.html</span></span>.

</div>
<div class="Standard">

It can calculate area and pixel value statistics of user-defined selections. It can measure distances and angles. It can create density histograms and line profile plots. It supports standard image processing functions such as contrast manipulation, sharpening, smoothing, edge detection and median filtering.

</div>
<div class="Standard">

It does geometric transformations such as scaling, rotation and flips. Image can be zoomed up to 32 : 1 and down to 1 : 32. All analysis and processing functions are available at any magnification factor. The program supports any number of windows (images) simultaneously, limited only by available memory.

</div>
<div class="Standard">

Spatial calibration is available to provide real world dimensional measurements in units such as millimeters. Density or gray scale calibration is also available.

</div>
<div class="Standard">

ImageJ was designed with an open architecture that provides extensibility via Java plugins. Custom acquisition, analysis and processing plugins can be developed using ImageJ’s built in editor and Java compiler. User-written plugins make it possible to solve almost any image processing or analysis problem.

</div>
<div class="Standard">

Being public domain open source software, an ImageJ user has the [http://wikieducator.org/The_right_license/The_essential_freedoms four essential freedoms] defined by the Richard Stallman in 1986: 1) The freedom to run the program, for any purpose; 2) The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish; 3) The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor; 4) The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits.

</div>
<div class="Standard">

ImageJ is being developed on Mac OS X using its built in editor and Java compiler, plus the ''BBEdit'' editor and the ''Ant'' build tool. The source code is freely [http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/developer/source/index.html available]. The author, Wayne Rasband ([mailto:wsr@nih.gov wsr@nih.gov]), is a Special Volunteer at the National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.

==Installing and Maintaining ImageJ==

<div class="Standard">

ImageJ can be downloaded from http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html. Details on how to install ImageJ on [[#index-Linux|↓]][http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/install/linux.html Linux], [http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/install/mac.html Mac OS 9], [[#index-Mac-OS-X|↓]][http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/install/osx.html Mac OS X] and [[#index-Windows-(OS)|↓]][http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/install/windows.html Windows] <span class="bibcites">[[[#biblio-1|1]]]</span> are available at http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/install/ (<span class="sans"><span class="menuitem"><span class="sans">Help ▷ [[#sub:Installation...|Installation…↓]]</span></span></span> command). Specially useful are the platform-specific ''Troubleshooting'' and ''Known Problems'' sections. [[#index-Fiji|↓]][[#sub:Fiji-intro|Fiji↓]] installation is described at http://fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/Downloads.

</div>
<div class="Standard">

The downloaded package may not contain the latest bug fixes so it is recommended to upgrade ImageJ right after a first installation. [[#index-Updates|↓]]Updating IJ[[#nom-ij|↓]] consists only of running <span class="sans"><span class="menuitem"><span class="sans">Help ▷ [[#sub:Update-ImageJ...|Update ImageJ…↓]]</span></span></span>, which will install the latest <span class="Filename">[http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/upgrade/ ij.jar]</span> in the ImageJ folder (on Linux and Windows) or inside the ImageJ.app (on Mac OS X).

</div>
<div class="Standard">

<span class="sans"><span class="menuitem"><span class="sans">Help ▷ [[#sub:Update-ImageJ...|Update ImageJ…↓]]</span></span></span> can be used to upgrade (or downgrade) the <span class="Filename">ij.jar</span> file to ''release updates'' or ''daily builds''. Release updates are announced frequently on the [http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/notes.html IJ news website] and are labelled alphabetically (e.g., v. 1.43m). Typically, these releases contain several new features and bug fixes, described in detail on the [http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/notes.html ImageJ News page]. ''Daily builds,'' on the other hand, are labelled with numeric sub-indexes (e.g., v. 1.43n4) and are often released without documentation. Nevertheless, if available, release notes for daily builds can be found at http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/source/release-notes.html. When a release cycle ends (v. 1.42 ended with 1.42q, v. 1.43 with 1.43u, etc.) an ''installation package'' is created, downloadable from http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html. Typically, this package is bundled with a small list of add-ons ([[#sub:Macros-ExtendingIJ|Macros↓]], [[#sub:Scripts|Scripts↓]] and [[#sub:Plugins|Plugins↓]]).

</div>

===ImageJDistributions===

<div class="Standard">

ImageJ alone is not that powerful: it’s real strength is the vast repertoire of [[#sub:Plugins|Plugins↓]] that extend ImageJ’s functionality beyond its basic core. The many hundreds, probably thousands, freely available plugins from contributors around the world play a pivotal role in ImageJ’s success <span class="bibcites">[[[#biblio-162|<span class="bib-index">112</span>]]]</span>. Running <span class="sans"><span class="menuitem"><span class="sans">Help ▷ [[#sub:Update-ImageJ...|Update ImageJ…↓]]</span></span></span>, however, will not update any of the plugins you may have installed<span class="FootOuter"><span class="SupFootMarker"> [B] </span><span class="HoverFoot"><span class="SupFootMarker"> [B] </span>Certain plugins, however, provide self-updating mechanisms (e.g., [http://simon.bio.uva.nl/objectj/ ObjectJ] and the [[#index-Bio-Formats|↓]][http://loci.wisc.edu/software/bio-formats OME Bio-Formats]).</span></span>.

</div>
<div class="Standard">

ImageJ add-ons ([[#sub:Plugins|Plugins↓]], [[#sub:Scripts|Scripts↓]] and [[#sub:Macros-ExtendingIJ|Macros↓]]) are available from several sources ([http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/ ImageJ's plugins page] [<span class="sans"><span class="menuitem"><span class="sans">Help ▷ [[#sub:Plugins...|Plugins…↓]]</span></span></span>], [http://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/doku.php?id=plugin:start ImageJ Information and Documentation Portal] and [http://fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/Category:Plugins Fiji's webpage], among others) making manual updates of a daunting task. This reason alone, makes it extremely convenient the use of [[#sec:ImageJ-Distributions|ImageJDistributions↑]] bundled with a pre-organized collection of add-ons.

</div>
<div class="Standard">

Below is a list of the most relevant projects that address the seeming difficult task of organizing and maintaining ImageJ beyond its basics. If you are a life scientist and have doubts about which distribution to choose you should opt for [[#sub:Fiji-intro|Fiji↓]]. It is heavily maintained, offers an automatic updater, improved scripting capabilities and ships with powerful plugins. More specialized adaptations of ImageJ are discussed in [[#sub:Other-Software-Packages|Software Packages Built on Top of ImageJ↓]].

</div>
====Fiji====

<div class="Standard">

[http://fiji.sc/ Fiji][[#index-Fiji|↓]] (''Fiji Is Just ImageJ---Batteries included'') is a distribution of ImageJ together with Java, Java 3D and several plugins organized into a coherent menu structure. Citing its developers, “Fiji compares to ImageJ as Ubuntu compares to Linux”. The main focus of Fiji is to assist research in life sciences, targeting image registration, stitching, segmentation, feature extraction and 3D visualization, among others. It also supports many scripting languages (BeanScript, Clojure, Jython, Python, Ruby, ''see'' [[#sec:ScriptingOtherLang|Scripting in Other Languages↓]]). Importantly, Fiji ships with a [http://fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/Update_Fiji convenient updater] that knows whether your files are up-to-date, obsolete or locally modified. [http://fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/Documentation Comprehensive documentation] is available for most of its plugins. The Fiji project was presented publicly for the first time at the [http://imagejconf.tudor.lu/doku.php ImageJ User and Developer Conference] in November 2008.

</div>
====MBF ImageJ====

<div class="Standard">

The [[#index-MBF-ImageJ|↓]][[#index-ImageJ-for-Microscopy|↓]][http://www.macbiophotonics.ca/imagej/ MBF ImageJ bundle] or ''ImageJ for Microscopy'' (formerly [http://www.uhnres.utoronto.ca/facilities/wcif/imagej/ WCIF-ImageJ]) features a collection of plugins and macros, collated and organized by Tony Collins at the MacBiophotonics facility, McMaster University. It is accompanied by a [http://www.macbiophotonics.ca/imagej/ comprehensive manual] describing how to use the bundle with light microscopy image data. It is a great resource for microscopists but is not maintained actively, lagging behind the development of core ImageJ.

</div>
<div class="Standard">

Note that you can add plugins from MBF ImageJ to Fiji, combining the best of both programs. Actually, you can use multiple ImageJ distributions simultaneously, assemble your own ImageJ bundle by gathering the plugins that best serve your needs (probably, someone else at your institution already started one?) or create symbolic links to share plugins between different installations.

# Remember that in most cases you can find answers within your own ImageJ installation without even connecting to the internet since the heuristics for finding commands or writing macros have been significantly improved in later versions (''see'' [[#sec:Finding-Commands|Finding Commands↓]] and [[#sec:Extending-ImageJ|Extending ImageJ↓]]).
# As with any other mailing list, you should always follow basic [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netiquette netiquette], namely:
## Use descriptive subject lines — ''Re: Problem with Image&gt;Set Scale command'' is much more effective than a general ''Re: Problem.''
## Stay on topic — Do not post off-topic messages, unrelated to the message thread.
## Be careful when sending attachments — Refrain from attaching large files. Use, e.g., a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_hosting_service#Comparison_of_notable_file_hosting_services file hosting service] instead.
## Edit replies — You should include only the minimum content that is necessary to provide a logical flow from the question to the answer, i.e., quote only as much as absolutely necessary and relevant.
