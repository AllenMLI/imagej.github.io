The purpose of Fiji's Updater is to keep you up-to-date with all components of Fiji, i.e. ImageJ, the plugins and the core components (libraries) needed by the plugins.

As of Fiji Madison, the Fiji Updater can handle [[#Adding update sites|3rd-party update sites]], i.e. anybody with write access to a web server can set up their own update site which users can decide to follow.

== Automatic Update ==

The Fiji Updater is a mechanism to update individual packages in Fiji.  It is automatically run when all the following conditions are met:

* Fiji was just started
* Fiji was started without parameters (i.e. no Drag 'n Drop onto the Fiji icon)
* Fiji's files can be updated by the current user
* There is a network connection

If there were updates since the Updater was run the last time, Fiji will ask whether you want to run the Updater now or later:

In case you do not want to run the Updater upon startup, you can choose ''Never''; this setting can be adjusted in [[#Configure the Updater|''Edit>Options>Configure Fiji Updater'']], too.

== Starting the Updater explicitely ==

The Updater can be run via ''Help>Update Fiji''.

== Easy mode ==

The Updater has two modes, the ''Easy Mode'' and the ''Advanced Mode''.  In the former mode, you will only see the files that can be updated.  The easy mode looks like this:

For technical reasons, a restart of Fiji is required before the changes take effect. You can read about technical details [[Uploading plugins|here]].

=== Resolve dependencies ===

Some plugins require other components to be updated. For example, the [[Simple Neurite Tracer]] needs the [[3D Viewer]]. If you have a locally modified version of the dependency (i.e. the Fiji Updater does not know that particular version), Fiji will ask you what to do:

A typical scenario when you can have a locally modified version of a component is when you asked the respective plugin author for a change in a Fiji component and got a test version that you [[Installing 3rd party plugins|installed manually]].

You can keep the local version if you are certain that the version you have is new enough to work with the plugin noted under the text ''A newer version might be required by'', otherwise you should consider to choose ''Update <component>'' instead.

== Advanced mode ==

In the advanced mode, you can see details about the Fiji components, choose not to update selected components, and search by filename.

Note: in the advanced mode you can also upload plugins to your [[Update Sites|update site]]. The details for each component can be edited by writing below the respective entry. To save the changes, you have to upload the plugin to the server.

== Advanced Mode / Update Java ==

In ''Advanced Mode'', you can update your Fiji-specific Java. Just click the ''Update Java'' button:

== Configuring the Updater ==

When the updater detects that there are updates available, it offers the user the choice: update right now, delay (i.e. ask again in one week), or disable the startup check.

If you disabled the startup check, you can reenable it via ''Edit>Options>Configure Fiji Updater'':

== Adding update sites ==

If you want to update plugins from other update sites than the principal one, follow [[How to follow a 3rd party update site|these instructions]].

You can also [[How to set up and populate an update site|set up and populate your own update site]].

== Command-line usage ==

It is possible to drive the Updater through Fiji's command-line option ''--update''. If you call that without arguments, it will show you what subcommands are available:

<source lang="bash">
./fiji --update
</source>

The simplest usage is to update either single files:

<source lang="bash">
./fiji --update update jars/ij.jar jars/Fiji.jar plugins/Fiji_Updater.jar
</source>

or all files that would be marked for update in the interactive Updater by default:

<source lang="bash">
./fiji --update update
</source>

If you configured upload sites, you can also use the command-line version of the Updater to upload files:

<source lang="bash">
./fiji --update upload plugins/My_New_Cool_Plugin.jar
</source>
