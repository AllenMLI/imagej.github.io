The purpose of Fiji's Updater is to keep you up-to-date with all components of Fiji, i.e. ImageJ, the plugins and the core components (libraries) needed by the plugins.

As of Fiji Madison, the Fiji Updater can handle [[#Adding update sites|3rd-party update sites]], i.e. anybody with write access to a web server can set up their own update site which users can decide to follow.

== Automatic Update ==

The Fiji Updater is a mechanism to update individual packages in Fiji.  It is automatically run when all the following conditions are met:

* Fiji was just started
* Fiji was started without parameters (i.e. no Drag 'n Drop onto the Fiji icon)
* Fiji's files can be updated by the current user
* There is a network connection

If there were updates since the Updater was run the last time, Fiji will ask whether you want to run the Updater now or later:

In case you do not want to run the Updater upon startup, you can choose ''Never''.

== Starting the Updater explicitly ==

The Updater can be run via ''Help>Update Fiji''.

== Easy mode ==

The Updater has two modes, the ''Easy Mode'' and the ''Advanced Mode''.  In the former mode, you will only see the files that can be updated.  The easy mode looks like this:

[[Image:Updater-easy-mode.png]]

For technical reasons, a restart of Fiji is required before the changes take effect. You can read about technical details [[Uploading plugins|here]].

=== Resolve dependencies ===

Some plugins require other components to be updated. For example, the [[Simple Neurite Tracer]] needs the [[3D Viewer]]. If you have a locally modified version of the dependency (i.e. the Fiji Updater does not know that particular version), Fiji will ask you what to do:

[[Image:Updater-Resolve_dependencies.png]]

A typical scenario when you can have a locally modified version of a component is when you asked the respective plugin author for a change in a Fiji component and got a test version that you [[Installing 3rd party plugins|installed manually]].

You can keep the local version if you are certain that the version you have is new enough to work with the plugin noted under the text ''A newer version might be required by'', otherwise you should consider to choose ''Update <component>'' instead.

== Advanced mode ==

In the advanced mode, you can see details about the Fiji components, choose not to update selected components, and search by filename.

Note: in the advanced mode you can also upload plugins to your [[Update Sites|update site]]. The details for each component can be edited by writing below the respective entry. To save the changes, you have to upload the plugin to the server.

== Starting the Updater manually ==

Just click on the ''Help>Update Fiji'' menu item:

[[Image:Fiji_Updater-screenshot.png]]

== Adding update sites ==

If you want to update plugins from other update sites than the principal one, follow [[How to follow a 3rd party update site|these instructions]].

You can also [[How to set up and populate an update site|set up and populate your own update site]].

== Command-line usage ==

It is possible to drive the Updater through Fiji's command-line option ''--update''. If you call that without arguments, it will show you what subcommands are available:

<source lang="bash">
./fiji --update
</source>

The simplest usage is to update either single files:

<source lang="bash">
./fiji --update update jars/ij.jar jars/Fiji.jar plugins/Fiji_Updater.jar
</source>

or all files that would be marked for update in the interactive Updater by default:

<source lang="bash">
./fiji --update update
</source>

If you configured upload sites, you can also use the command-line version of the Updater to upload files:

<source lang="bash">
./fiji --update upload plugins/My_New_Cool_Plugin.jar
</source>

Full list of options available when running Fiji from command line looks like this:

<source lang="bash">
Commands:
	diff [ --list-files | --javap | --class-file-diff | --hex-diff ] [<files>]
	list [<files>]
	list-uptodate [<files>]
	list-not-uptodate [<files>]
	list-updateable [<files>]
	list-modified [<files>]
	list-current [<files>]
	list-local-only [<files>]
	list-from-site <name>
	show [<files>]
	update [<files>]
	update-force [<files>]
	update-force-pristine [<files>]
	upload [--simulate] [--[update-]site <name>] [--force-shadow] [--forget-missing-dependencies] [<files>]
	upload-complete-site [--simulate] [--force] [--force-shadow] [--platforms <platform>[,<platform>...]] <name>
	list-update-sites [<nick>...]
	add-update-site <nick> <url> [<host> <upload-directory>]
	edit-update-site <nick> <url> [<host> <upload-directory>]
</source>

In order to update from command line using  a specific update site (for example the BigDataViewer) use the following command:

<source lang="bash">
./fiji-linux64 --update add-update-site BigDataViewer http://sites.imagej.net/Pietzsch/
</source>

== Bootstrapping the updater ==

If you do not have Fiji yet, you can download [http://update.imagej.net/bootstrap.js bootstrap.js] and run it like this:

<source lang="bash">
jrunscript bootstrap.js help
</source>

This uses the '''jrunscript''' executable of your Java installation to run the Javascript file tracked in Fiji's [https://github.com/fiji/fiji/blob/master/plugins/Scripts/Plugins/Utilities/Fix_Updater.js source code repository] that was originally intended to fix existing installations, but enhanced to initialize the updater in an ImageJ 1.x-only directory -- or even from a complete fresh state.

== Development ==

As of September 2012, the Fiji Updater has moved to ImageJ2. Details can be found in the announcement: [[2012-09-14 - The Updater moved]].
