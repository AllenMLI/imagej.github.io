The original Trainable Segmentation library and plugins (Trainable Segmentation and Advanced Weka Segmentation) have been refactored for the sake of simplicity into a unified plugin and library called [[Trainable Weka Segmentation]].

The plugin is just a renaming of the former Advanced Weka Segmentation so it keeps complete backwards-compatibility. The old and unmaintained Trainable Segmentation plugin has been marked as deprecated and moved to Plugins > Segmentation > deprecated.
