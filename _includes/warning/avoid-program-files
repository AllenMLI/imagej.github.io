If you are installing ImageJ on Windows, we strongly recommend that you store
your ImageJ.app directory somewhere in your user space
(e.g., `C:\Users\[your name]\ImageJ.app`) rather than in `C:\Program Files` or
other system-wide directory. If you move ImageJ.app to such a directory, modern
versions of Windows will deny ImageJ write permission to its own directory
structure, preventing it from being able to update. See also
