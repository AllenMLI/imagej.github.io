== What can ImageJ do? ==

ImageJ provides:

* A [[Getting started#Fiji.27s_main_window|user interface]] with functions to load, display, and save images.
* A wealth of image analysis [[techniques]]: [http://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-29.html#toc-Section-29 image processing], [[colocalization]], [[deconvolution]], [[registration]], [[segmentation]], [[tracking]], [[visualization]] and much more.
* An extension mechanism including support for [[plugins]] and [[macros]].
* A vibrant, diverse, and helpful user [[community]] that gives rise to insightful scientific exchanges.

ImageJ's [[extensibility]] is truly the root of its effectiveness: many advanced image-processing methods are not provided by the core application, but rather made available as third-party [[plugins]] via [[update sites]] written by specialists in the corresponding fields.

== How do I get started? ==

* Get ImageJ from the [[Downloads]] page
* Read the [[Getting started]] tutorial.
* Then peruse the [[User Guide]] and other [[tutorials]].
