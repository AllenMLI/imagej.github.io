== What is ImageJ? ==

ImageJ is an [[open source]] image processing program for multidimensional image data with a focus on scientific imaging.


ImageJ has grown significantly due largely to being [[open source|freely available]] and its vibrant and helpful user community.  Uses of ImageJ range from data visualization and teaching to advanced image processing and statistical analysis. The softwareâ€™s [[extensibility]] continues to attract biologists at all career stages as well as computer scientists who wish to effectively implement specific image-processing algorithms.  Open-source software, such as the [[ImageJ2|ImageJ project]], fosters its suites of software tools, making multitudes of image-analysis technology easily accessible to the scientific community.

== What can ImageJ do? ==

ImageJ provides:

* A [[Getting started#Fiji.27s_main_window|user interface]] with functions to load, display, and save images.
* Basic [http://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-29.html#toc-Section-29 image processing functionality].
* A wealth of advanced image processing [[techniques]], including [[colocalization]], [[deconvolution]], [[registration]], [[segmentation]], [[tracking]], [[visualization]] and much more.
* An extension mechanism including support for [[plugins]] and [[macros]].

ImageJ's [[extensibility]] is truly the root of its effectiveness: many advanced image-processing methods are not provided by the core application, but rather made available as third-party [[plugins]] via [[update sites]] written by specialists in the corresponding fields.

== How do I get started? ==

* Get ImageJ from the [[Downloads]] page
* Read the [[Getting started]] tutorial.
* Then peruse the [[User Guide]] and other [[tutorials]].
