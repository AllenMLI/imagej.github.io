The previous TrackMate tutorial - [[Manual editing of tracks using TrackMate]] is dedicated to manually correcting the results of an automated process. This small tutorial here shows how to do a fully manual annotation with TrackMate.

== Setting up. == 

[[Image:TrackMate ManualTrackingEntryPoint.png|right|border|]]

There is not much to do. We will use the same, simple dataset that for [[Getting started with TrackMate]]. You can find it in ''File > Open Samples > Tracks for TrackMate (807K)''. 

As for the TrackMate plugin, you could start it up normally, selecting '' Plugins > Tracking > TrackMate'' in the menu, and then when offered to select a detector and a tracker, always pick the manual one. That would work well, but we offered another entry point that has a simpler GUI dedicated to manual tracking. Pick the ''Plugins > Tracking > Manual tracking with TrackMate'' menu item. 

You should should get the layout pictured on the right. Notice that we are already displaying the ''Display options'' panel of the classic GUI, and that the ''previous'' button is disabled at the bottom. Notice also that the color scales for both spot and track features display a dummy range.

== Creating spots one by one. ==

The default view (the one that re-uses the HyperStack viewer of ImageJ) can readily edit the tracks. You just have to make sure that the TrackMate tool is selected in the ImageJ toolbar:

With this tool selected, you can now make the image window active and use the mouse of the keyboard to create spots. Here are the commands for the mouse:

* '''Double-click''' anywhere in the image to create a spot and enter the edit mode. The edited spot is highlighted with a green, dashed circle, as pictured below:

* To leave the edit mode, '''double-click''' again anywhere. The spot is then added to the data model.
* To edit it again, '''double-click inside the spot'''. Its outline is now dashed; you are back in the edit mode. 
* While in the edit mode, you can move the edited spot around by clicking inside the spot and dragging it around. The spot will follow you if you change the time or the Z slider, and it will be added to the right plane upon leaving the edit mode.
* You can also change its radius by using '''Alt+Mouse wheel'''. Using '''Shift+Alt''' changes the spot radius faster. 


This is how you edit the data with the mouse. You can also use the keyboard:

* To create (or <u>a</u>dd) a spot, press '''A''' with the mouse at the desired location. By default, the new spot will have the radius of the last spot you edited with the double-click mode. So if you want to have all spots of a certain radius, edit a spot by double-clicking inside it, set its radius using ''Alt+Mouse wheel'', and leave the edit mode. This will "capture" the spot radius and apply it anywhere after. 
* To move a spot around, press '''Space''' with the mouse over the target spot. Then move the mouse around. No need for mouse clicks. 
* To <u>d</u>elete a spot, press the '''D''' key with the mouse over the target spot. 
* To change a spot radius, press '''Q''' and '''E''' over the target spot. '''Shift+Q''' and '''Shift+E''' change the radius by a larger amount. 

And that's it for spot creation.

== Create links ==

All we have done so far was to create single spots, that are not part of any tracks. Tracks are created on the fly when you link several spots together. You can do it in [[TrackScheme]], as explained elsewhere. Here is how to do it directly on the image.
