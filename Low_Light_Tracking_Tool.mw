==Load the data==
[[Image:OpenData.png]]

Load the image stack to be tracked. Use whichever method you prefer in Fiji.
After the data is loaded, start the plugin
==Starting the Plugin==

Enter intensity offset, and Î”Z ratio. 

The Offset applies if there is a minimum value that the camera registers. 
Example: some microscopes would not allow a value under 100, so in that case you would enter 100 as the offset.

The z ratio, is the slice thickness, divided by the pixel width. This value is only used for 3D data.
Example: My pixel size for my data is 100 nm, and my slice thickness is 200 nm. I would then enter a value of 2.

==2D Data==

When the plugin starts you have three windows.  The main data window lets you move through the slices like normal. On the sides you see the two kymographs, which make is easier to see movement over time.

If you would like the windows to become larger, or smaller change the size of the data window and then select arrange windows, from the view menu. Or use Ctrl-W.  Arrange windows, will also organize the windows if they have become scattered.

The control panel is the other window you will see that will allow you to do the tracking.
