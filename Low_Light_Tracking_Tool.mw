This software implements the tracking method described in the following paper:
"A Divide and Conquer Strategy for the Maximum Likelihood localization of Ultra Low Intensity Objects" By Alexander Krull et al, 2013 (Final Journal).
 
==Load the data==
[[Image:OpenData.png]]

Load the image stack to be tracked. Use whichever method you prefer in Fiji.
After the data is loaded, start the plugin.

==Starting the Plugin==

[[Image:GlobalOptions.png]]

Enter intensity offset, and Î”Z ratio. 

The Offset applies if there is a minimum value that the camera registers. 
Example: Some microscopes would not allow a value under 100, so in that case you would enter 100 as the offset.

The z ratio, is the slice thickness, divided by the pixel width. This value is only used for 3D data.
Example: My pixel size for my data is 100 nm, and my slice thickness is 200 nm. I would then enter a value of 2.

==2D Data==

When the plugin starts you have three windows.  The main data window lets you move through the slices like normal. On the sides you see the two kymographs, which make is easier to see movement over time.

If you would like the windows to become larger, or smaller change the size of the data window and then select arrange windows, from the view menu. Or use Ctrl-W.  Arrange windows, will also organize the windows if they have become scattered.

The control panel is the other window you will see that will allow you to do the tracking.

===Create Session===

[[Image:NewSession.png]]

Click on the New Session button, or select from the menu.  The New session window opens.  Here you can pick a name for the session, your tracking method, and which channel you want to track.  

====Tracking Methods====

===Pick Session Options===

[[Image:SessionOptions.png]]

After clicking Ok, a new window will open. In this window you can choose a manual sigma, or select automatic sigma.  Min and Max are only used if automatic is selected. 

You also can set your quality threshold.  Smaller numbers are higher quality, while larger numbers are lower quality but faster. 

Automatic sigma can also be slower, this is more so for 3D data.

This can be changed from the Session Options menu, under edit.

===Select Objects to Track===
To track an object, make sure the cross hair icon in the fiji toolbar is selected and then double click on the object you would like to track in the data window. This will create a circle around the object. An entry will then be in the table in the control panel. You can change the label by clicking on the text in the label field, or change the color by clicking on the colored area.

===Edit Dots===

[[Image:ObjectOption.png]]

If at this point you find that the parameters you picked were less ideal you can change the parameters. If you change the session options, that only affects new selections. So you have two options, delete the old ones, or change their parameters with the edit Object selection from the edit menu.

===Start Tracking===

Only the highlighted objects will be tracked.  So in this example, both are highlighted and will be tracked at the same time.

At this point you have three options.  

First, if you have automatic sigma selected you can use the optimize button. This will optimize the sigma value, and then you can turn off automatic sigma for each object. This will make the tracking faster.

Second, if you have noisy data you can select the Multiscale method. This will use iterative smoothing to find the object. You can change the default behavior in the edit menu.

Third, click on Start Tracking.

===Result===

[[Image:Result1.png]]

You can watch the lines follow they kymograph as the tracking is in progress.  If you see the tracking looks incorrect and lost the object you can click on Stop Tracking and adjust the object location and the software will resume from the new starting point.

[[Image:Result2.png]]

The table now contains more information now, with the first frame of the trace, and the last frame.  Double clicking on the ID# of the object will jump the frame number to the beginning and end of the trace. 

The data is already saved automatically by default. You can turn that off by unchecking the Auto Save box.  

You can also reload previously tracked data by clicking on the address bar and navigating to the data's location.  You can then retrack, or examine the data. 



==3D Data==

[[Image:NewWindows.jpg]]

3D data is very similar to 2D data, there are just a few more windows that open when you start. The data window, and the kymographs appears, but a second set of windows appear.  A max Z projection window, and max Y and X projects. The side projections are useful to place your starting tracking in the correct slice. So before clicking on the object in the data window, change the z to the correct plane first. 

Otherwise, tracking function is the same. It is best to optimize the sigma value for 3D tracking, and then use a fixed value to increase speed.

==Tips==

If you have multichannel data, each channel needs its own session.  You can select which sessions are visible by checking their boxes in the Visible Sessions list. You can use the current session drop down menu to switch between sessions. 

Using the Merge, Split, Trim, and Delete buttons allows you to edit your traces by combining or deleting them. One useful exampling is if your object disappears periodically but you know that it is not a new object, and would like to combine the two seperate traces you create. 

You can zoom into the kymographs by moving the cursor over the kymograph window and holding down shift, while using the scroll wheel on the mouse.
