Even though one could use any Java library to make a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for a script or plugin, there are mostly 2 ways to make GUI in Fiji.<br>All those methods can be used with the scripting languages (including the IJ macro language for the script parameters). 

== [[Script parameters|Script Parameters]] ==
This is the simplest option to make a GUI in Fiji.<br>
GUI items (integer, string input...) are created by using a generic notation in the form <code>#@ ParameterType VariableName</code> that is put at the top of the script.<br>
There are as many notations/lines as there are items to put in the GUI, and the items are rendered on top of each other in the resulting interface in the order of appearance in the code.<br>


In practice, the script parameters are the quickest option to make a GUI in Fiji but they do not offer as many options as the GenericDialog class (no custom layout, no Help button, no custom button).



== [[Generic dialog|GenericDialog]]  ==
This class (and its subclasses) offers more possibilities than the script parameters (custom layout and buttons) but requires more coding (e.g. parameters recall between successive calls to the plugin is not automatic).
