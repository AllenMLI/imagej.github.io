Even though one could use any Java library to make a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for a script or plugin, there are mostly 2 ways to make GUI in Fiji.<br>

== [[Script parameters|Script Parameters]] ==
This is the simplest option to make a GUI in Fiji.<br>
It uses a generic notation like <code>#@ ParameterType VariableName</code>.

== [[Generic dialog|GenericDialog]]  ==
This class (and its subclasses) offers more possibilities than the script parameters but requires more coding.
