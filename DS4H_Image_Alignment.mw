== Description ==

Data Science for Health (DS4H) Image Alignment is a plugin developed to overlap biological images by specifying few visible reference marks.
The overlapping is done by automatically implementing a least-squares method that approximates the solution of the mathematical overdetermined system, so to define the registration matrix then used for aligning the different images.

It also considers rotations and scale changes in case the images to be aligned are dilated/shrinked. 

Finally, it provides an iterative subroutine for a fine alignment, to easily reach a very good image co-registration quality. 

== Image support ==

All the most common biological image formats (like .svs, .ndpi2 etc.) are supported and openable directly from the plugin.
This has been possible Thanks to the use of the [[Bio-formats]] library.
