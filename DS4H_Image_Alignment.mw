== Description ==

"Data Science for Health (DS4H) Image Alignment" is a user-friendly tool freely provided as an ImageJ/Fiji plugin. With DS4H Image Alignment, 2D images can be easily aligned (i.e. co-registered) by defining with a few clicks some well visible reference marks. 

The implemented least-squares method automatically approximates the solution of the mathematical overdetermined system, so to define the registration matrix then used for aligning the different images. It also considers rotations and scale changes in case of object dilation/shrink. Finally, it provides an iterative subroutine for a fine alignment, to easily reach a very good image co-registration quality.

== Implementation ==

DS4H Image Alignment has been implemented in Java as a plugin for ImageJ/Fiji. It works with “.svs” files, but also all the medical imaging formats included in the [[Bio-formats]] library.



== Download ==

DS4H Image Alignment is freely available, together with a sample dataset and a video tutorial. 

To install DS4H Image Alignment follow the instructions reported on the Video Tutorial. Basically, you have to copy the DS4H Image Alignment ".jar" file in the plugins folder of Imagej/Fiji.

- ImageJ/Fiji plugin (".jar" file), to be copied in the plugins folder of Imagej/Fiji.

- Sample dataset (1 MB), with a few images useful to test DS4H Image Alignment.
