== Description ==

Data Science for Health (DS4H) Image Alignment is a plugin developed to align biological images by manually specifying visible reference marks.
Warping of the single original images is done according to a least-squares method that approximates the solution of the mathematical overdetermined system, so to define the registration matrix then used for aligning the different images.

It also considers rotations and scale changes in case the images to be aligned are dilated/shrinked.

Finally, it provides an iterative subroutine for a fine alignment, to easily reach good image co-registration quality. 

== Image support ==

All the most common biological image formats (like .tiff, .svs, .ndpi2, etc.) are supported and openable directly from the plugin.
This has been possible thanks to the use of the [[Bio-formats]] library.
