== Introduction ==
There is an increasing demand to image large biological specimen at high resolution. Typically those specimen do not fit in the field of view of the microscope. To overcome this drawback, motorized stages moving the sample are used to create a tiled scan of the whole specimen. The physical coordinates provided by the microscope stage are not precise enough to allow reconstruction (”Stitching”) of the whole image from individual image stacks.

The Stitching Plugin (2d-5d) is able to reconstruct big images/stacks from an arbitrary number of tiled input images/stacks, making use of the Fourier Shift Theorem that computes all possible translations (x, y[, z]) between two 2d/3d images at once, yielding the best overlap in terms of the cross correlation measure. If more than two input images/stacks are used the correct placement of all tiles is determined using a global optimization. The stitching is able to align an arbitrary amount of channels and supports timelapse registration. To remove brightness differences at the tile borders, non-linear intensity blending can be applied. 

Plase note: this is the new implementation of the Stitching plugin which is finally based on [[Imglib]] and supports a lot of new features:

* supports composite images and hyperstacks now
* it can write the stitched image slice-by-slice directly to disk (significantly reduces the RAM requirements)
* it can open the input images as Virtual Stacks (significantly reduces the RAM requirements)
* supports timelapse alignment with different stitching options
* subpixel-resolution
* supports many different types of grids (row-by-row, column-by-column, snake, ...)
* can read the approximate tile positions from the image metadata

Due to the virtual input stacks and the direct export of the result to disk It is now possible to stitch an arbitrary amount of image tiles with limited RAM resources.
