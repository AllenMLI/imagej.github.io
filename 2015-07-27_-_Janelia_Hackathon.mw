From Sunday, July 27, 2015 through Friday, July 31, 2015, [[User:Saalfeld|Stephan Saalfeld]] at HHMI Janelia in Ashburn, Virginia hosted [[LOCI]]'s [[User:Rueden|Curtis Rueden]] and [[User:Hinerm|Mark Hiner]] for a hackathon to unify [[SCIFIO]]/[[ImgLib2]] development efforts (with MPI-CBG's [[User:Pietzsch|Tobias Pietzsch]]), improve support for the Janelia KLB format (with Janelia's Burkhard Hoeckendorf), and improve the development tools available for [[Fiji]] developers.

== Executive summary ==
 
* SCIFIO is headed in a great direction:
** Will integrate it better into modern, powerful software tools including ImgLib2 and [[BigDataViewer]].
** Big step toward breaking the limitations of [[ImageJ1]], in particular the 2GPix plane barrier and limited image types.
** Will make possible things like more transparent and rapid ability to work with multi-position and multi-angle datasets (mosaics, light sheet, etc.).
* Stability of [[ImageJ]] and Fiji—and other applications built on [[SciJava]] components—is now easier to validate.

== Technical discussions ==

* Unify BigDataViewer and SCIFIO/SciJava cell caches, and caching in general
* Unify SCIFIO and ImgLib2 metadata data structures
* Improve Maven tooling for releases and testing.
* KLB block-based file format:
** Generalize SCIFIO's core API to use N-D blocks instead of planes.
** Consider pure Java implementation of KLB to avoid native lib issues.
** Enable multithreaded I/O in SCIFIO as painlessly as possible.

== Progress this week ==

* Curtis wrote a "melting pot" script for testing component changes in the context of a larger application (e.g.: "Would this change to TrakEM2 break Fiji?") [[https://github.com/scijava/scijava-scripts/commit/d611704204d607dc94654a6810d00a1ab0e9280e 1]].
* Curtis made some ImageJ improvements in response to feedback from Burkhard [[https://github.com/imagej/imagej-plugins-commands/commit/6fafbc9c3444e3fe70420244699d02acfb72abfd 2], [https://github.com/imagej/imagej-plugins-commands/commit/ea9596b2d905eff9f7a9b2177dca5fe44b65ae6e 3]].
* Mark fixed bugs in SCIFIO cell caching in preparation for unification [[https://github.com/imglib/imglib2-ij/pull/5 4]].
* Mark and Curtis planned out the new SCIFIO API for "blockization".
* Mark began work on ImageJ data model changes for SCIFIO "blockization" [[https://github.com/imagej/imagej-common/compare/calibrated-interval 5], [https://github.com/scifio/scifio/compare/blocks-are-so-plane 6]].

== Future directions ==

* Jenkins automation of melting-pot for Fiji testing.
* Wiki documentation on how to use the melting-pot for testing your components.
* Completion of development on the SCIFIO "blockization" and unification of ImgLib2 data structures and caching.
* Convert KLB native code to a pure Java SCIFIO format implementation.
