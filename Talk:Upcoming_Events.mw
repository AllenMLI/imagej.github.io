== Remove the "Other info" column? ==
Is the "Other info" useful? Most of those things should be linked from the main site, right? I'd rather keep only one central link to the event's front page, because:
* It makes the table less wide.
* It is easier to maintain, and avoids some future broken links.
* It eliminates the burden of deciding which info is important enough to reside there.
Thoughts?

no worries... we can remove it.  I was motivated to include that mainly for the satellite workshop for the ABRF meeting...  but you are right - less is more (and easier to maintain)  I'll remove it now.
