After you have [[BigStitcher_Interest_points|detected interest points]] in your images, you can proceed to register them. In '''MultiView mode''', select the views to be registered, right-click and choose {{bc|Processing|Register using Interest Points...}}.

The interest point-based registration consists of two steps:
*1) '''Pairwise Matching''' of '''corresponding''' interest points in two views/view groups. For this step, we offer a variety of algorithms (see below).
*2) Iterative '''Global Optimization''' of the registration (estimation of consensus transformations when one view is linked to multiple others).

== Basic Registration Options ==

In the first dialog, you will be asked for some '''basic parameters''' for the registration.

* '''Registration algorithm''': how to perform the pairwise matching of interest points. The individual algorithms are described in detail below.
* '''Registration over time''': When your dataset contains multiple time points, you can choose to:
** '''Register time points individually''': to process each time point after the other. This way, the different views in each time point can be aligned, but no registration between time points is performed. It is generally a good idea to first register the views of the individual time points and then perform another round of registration to align them over time (keeping the registration within timepoints from the first round).
** '''Match against one reference time point (no global optimization)''': to align the views of all time points to a selected reference time point (In addition to aligning within the timepoints). Use this if you sample moved very little over time.
** '''All-to-all timepoints matching (global optimization)''': to compare every time point to every other time point. This is the most computationally expensive option but will provide a globally optimal time series registration.
** '''All-to-all timepoints matching with range('reasonable' global optimization)''': to compare each timepoint to neighboring time points in a defined range. This is a good compromise when your sample moved over time.
* '''Registration in between views:''' Whether to compare '''Only overlapping views''' or to '''Compare all views against each other'''. When you already have a rough alignment of the views, e.g. from microscope metadata or a first round of registration, we recommend to only compare overlapping views. Comparing all views will increase the computational cost but might be necessary when you have a bad or no pre-registration.
* '''Interest points''': the interest points to use for registration.
* '''Group Tiles''' and '''Group illuminations''': (Only available if you have multiple Tiles or Illuminations in your dataset) Tick this to group the Tiles and/or illumination directions within one Channel/Angle/TimePoint. Grouped views will be moved together. Use this if you already aligned Tiles in Stitching mode. Since we also have to do less comparisons this way, this will also speed up the registration process.

== Specific Registration Options ==

Depending on the choices you made in the previous dialog, you will be asked for some more specific parameters in the following dialog. The options here are grouped into 3 parts:

*1) '''Time Series Registration Options''' (only available if the dataset has multiple time points and you chose NOT to '''register timepoints individually''' in the first dialog)
*2) '''View Fixing and map-back Transformations''' (not available when registering relative to a '''refenence timepoint''')
*3) '''Registration Algorithm Parameters'''

=== Time Series Registration Options ===

If you chose to perform time series registration in the previous dialog, you will be asked for specific options here.

If you selected to '''Match against one reference time point (no global optimization)''' in the previous dialog, you will be asked to choose the '''reference time point''' here.

When performing '''All-to-all timepoints matching with range('reasonable' global optimization)''', you will be asked for the '''range''', i.e. how may preceding and succeeding time points to compare each time point to, here.

Furthermore, regardless of which time series registration scheme you use, you can select to '''Consider each time point as rigid unit'''. By selecting this, we will not move the views within a time point but only align the timepoints to each other. Use this if you performed a first round of registration using '''Register time points individually'''. 

=== View Fixing and map-back Transformations ===

After the pairwise matching of the interest points is done, we perform '''global optimization''' to determine transformations for the whole set of views from the pairwise transformations.

Since the registration works with ''relative transformations'' and will by default determine a non-identity transformation for all views, all views might move a little in an unpredictable (but correct relative to each other) way. 
You might, however, want to keep one or more views where they are and only move the others relative to them.

There are two, roughly equivalent, ways of achieving this:
* '''View Fixing''': keep some view(s) at their original location in the optimization progress (restrict their transform to identity). 
* '''Mapping back the views''': calculate a transformation that "undoes" the registration for a reference view and apply that to all views (moving the reference view back to its original location but keeping optimized relative transformations).

The following settings in the '''Advanced Registration Parameters''' dialog control view fixing and mapping back:

*'''Fix Views:''' You can select to fix the '''First View''', to manually '''Select Fixed Views''' or turn view fixing off by selecting '''Do not fix'''.
*'''Map back Views:''' You can select to '''Map back to first View''' using either a Translation model or a rigid model or '''Map back to user defined view''', with the same options for transformation models. You can also turn mapping back off via '''Do not map back (use this if views are fixed)'''. Note that if your registration results in a more complex transform (e.g. Affine) than  the translation/rigid map back model, the mapping back will "undo" the registration as well as possible, but not perfectly.

If you chose to '''manually''' select the views to fix or map back to, you will be asked for those views in another dialog after clicking '''OK'''.

When '''registering timepoints individually''', you will be asked whether you want to fix/map back to the same view in each timepoint or select different ones for each time point.

When manually selecting '''views to fix''', you can choose to fix multiple views (optionally per timepoint, see above). 

When '''mapping back''', you can select a single view to map back to.

=== Registration Algorithm Parameters ===

Depending on which '''Registration algorithm''' you selected in the first dialog, you will be asked for different options here. Note that the algorithms offer various levels of '''invariance:'''

* '''rotation invariance''': works even if the views are rotated and shifted relative to each other (according to the current transformations). Use this e.g. when aligning views from multiple angles. 
* '''translation invariance''': requires that the views are only shifted and not rotated relative to each other. Use this e.g. to correct thermal drift in time series.
* '''no invariance''': requires the views to already be roughly aligned to work. Use this for refinement of existing registrations.
