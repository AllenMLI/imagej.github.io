Many plugins have been published separately as summarized on our [[Publications|publications]] page. If possible, we would like to ask Fiji users to cite both the general publication above as well as the plugin specific paper. However, if journal reference limits interfere, the plugin specific publication should take precedence.

In general, please cite us - the long-term future of the project depends on it!

Thank you for your support.
