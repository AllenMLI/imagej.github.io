SciJava is a collaboration of projects providing software for scientific computing&mdash;an effort to cooperate and reuse code when feasible.

The following components are part of the '''[[Architecture|SciJava software stack]]''':
* [[SciJava Common]] - core shared library, with a powerful plugin framework and application container.
* [[ImgLib2]] - core library for N-dimensional image processing.
* [[SCIFIO]] - core library for N-dimensional image I/O.
* [[ImageJ2]] - library and application for N-dimensional image processing.
* [[Fiji]] - extension of [[ImageJ]] for life sciences research.

The following projects are part of the '''[[:Category:SciJava|SciJava pledge]]''' to work together, reuse code and synergize wherever possible:
* [[CellProfiler]]
* [[KNIME]]
* [[Bio-Formats]]
* [[OMERO]]
* [[Icy]]
* [[Alida]] and [[MiToBo]]

See the [[Architecture]] and [[Governance]] pages, as well as the [http://scijava.org/ SciJava web site], for further details.
