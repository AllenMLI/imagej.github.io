= What is metadata? =

When acquiring images in microscopy, the image files that are stored contain two main things:
* 1) image data, which are essentially 'pixel values'
* 2) metadata, information on the image data including pixel size, bit depth, dimension and objective information, etc.

Metadata is essential to correctly read image data; for example, to have accurate measurements, the image needs to be calibrated according to the correct/associated pixel size.  Saving and preserving metadata is key in quantitative image analysis.
