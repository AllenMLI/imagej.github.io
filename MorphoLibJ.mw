Collection of mathematical morphology methods and plugins for ImageJ, created at INRA-IJPB Modeling and Digital Imaging lab.

The library implements several functionalities that were missing in ImageJ, and that were not or only partially covered by other plugins. Namely:

* '''Morphological filtering''': erosion & dilation, closing & opening, morphological gradient & Laplacian, top-hat...

* '''Morphological reconstruction''', allowing fast detection of regional or extended extrema, removing of borders, or hole filling

* '''Watershed segmentation''' + GUI, making it possible to segment 2D/3D images of cell tissues

* '''2D/3D measurements''': volume, surface area, inertia ellipse/ellipsoid...

* '''Binary / label images utilities''' for removing or keeping largest connected component, perform size opening, fill holes, kill borders...

== Morphological filters ==
[[Image:MorphoLibJ-binary-dilation-erosion.png|right|thumb|400px|Some example of morphological filters. From left to right: original image (black over white), result of dilation, result of erosion.]] [[Image:MorphoLibJ-binary-gradient-close-open.png|right|thumb|400px|Some example of composed morphological filters. From left to right: result of morphological gradient, result of morphological closing, result of morphological opening.]] Morphological filters consider the neighborhood of each pixel/voxel according to a structuring element of a given size and shape.

The following filters are '''implemented both for 2D and 3D image'''s, and work for binary as well as grey level images:

* '''erosion''' keeps the minimum value within the neighborhood defined by the structuring element.

* '''dilation''' keeps the maximum value within the neighborhood defined by the structuring element.

* '''closing''' consists in the succession of a dilation with an erosion. Morphological closing makes dark structures smaller than the structuring element disappear.

* '''opening''' consists in the succession of an erosion with a dilation. Morphological opening makes bright structures smaller than the structuring element disappear.

* '''morphological gradient''' is defined as the difference of a morphological dilation and a morphological erosion with the same structuring element, and enhances edges of the original images.

* '''morphological Laplacien''' is defined as half the sum of a morphological dilation and a morphological erosion with the same structuring element, minus the original image, and enhances edges of the image.

* '''black top-hat''' consists in subtracting the original image from the result of a morphological closing, and results in the enhancement of dark structures smaller than structuring element.

* '''white top-hat''' consists in subtracting the result of a morphological opening from the original image, and results in the enhancement of bright structures smaller than structuring element.

The following structuring elements can be used for 2D images:

* disk 
* square
* octagon
* diamond
* line with angle of 0, 90, 45 or 135 degrees

For 3D images, the same structuring elements can be used (the operation is simply repeated on each slice), as well as a cubic structuring element.

== Morphological reconstruction ==
The morphological reconstruction is at the basis of many useful algorithms, such as border removing, hole filling, or detection of regional minima or maxima in grey level images.
=== Principle ===
The principle of geodesic reconstruction is to repeat '''conditional dilations''' or erosions until idempotence. Conditional dilation is the result of a dilation, combined with a mask image using a logical operation. Conditional dilations are repeated until no more modification occur (idempotence condition).

=== Applications ===
[[Image:MorphoLibJ-kill-borders-fill-holes.png|thumb|300px|Some applications of geodesic reconstruction. From left to right: original image, result of kill borders, result of fill holes.]]
By choosing the marker image, several operations may be automatized. For example, computing geodesic reconstruction with image of borders, and combining with original image will remove particles or regions touching the borders. In a similar way, computing geodesic reconstruction by using the border of the complement of the image makes it possible to fill holes that may appear in particles.

=== Usage ===

The following operations are available in the {{bc | Plugins | Fast Morphology}} menu:

* '''Geodesic Reconstruction''': compute the geodesic reconstruction by erosion or dilation using a marker image and a mask image, and a specified connectivity. The same operation is available for 3D images.
* '''Kill Borders''': remove the particles touching the border of a binary or grey level image, in 2D or 3D.
* '''Fill Holes''': remove holes inside particles in binary images, or remove dark regions surrounded by bright crests in grey level images. Works for both 2D and 3D images.
* '''Regional Min / Max''': compute regional minima or extrema in grey level image, with specified connectivity.
* '''Extended Min / Max''': compute extended minima or extrema in grey level image, with specified connectivity.
* '''Impose Min / Max''': impose minima or maxima on a grey level image.

== Watershed segmentation ==
[[Image:Classic-Watershed-lines-blur-blobs.png|thumb|200px|Overlay of watershed lines on blurred blobs.]] The watershed algorithm assimilates the grey level image to a digital elevation model, and aims at detecting the different catchment basins. In the grey-level image, the catchment basins correspond to dark regions surrounded by bright structures (the "crests"). It is a very popular technique specially used to segment touching objects. The MorphoLibJ suite contains several implementations of the algorithm and plugins that make use of it:

* [[Classic Watershed]], plugin implementing the original watershed algorithm by Pierre Soille and Luc M. Vincent (1990) to segment 2D/3D grayscale images.
* [[Marker-controlled Watershed]], a plugin to perform watershed by flooding from specific seed points or markers by Meyer and Beucher (1990).
* [[Morphological Segmentation]], a plugin with a graphical user interface to segment 2D/3D images based on morphological operations and the watershed algorithm.

== Installation ==

* In ImageJ, download the [https://github.com/ijpb/MorphoLibJ/releases latest released jar] into the ''plugins'' folder.

* In Fiji, you just need to [[How_to_follow_a_3rd_party_update_site#Add_update_sites | add]] the IJPB-plugins site to your list of update sites:

::: 1) Select {{bc | Help | Update...}} from the Fiji menu to start the updater.

::: 2) Click on ''Manage update sites''. This brings up a dialog where you can activate additional update sites.

::: 3) Activate the IJPB-plugins update site and close the dialog. Now you should see an additional jar file for download.

::: 4) Click ''Apply changes'' and restart Fiji.

== Documentation ==

The main source code directory is on GitHub under [http://github.com/ijpb/MorphoLibJ/tree/master/src/main/java/inra/ijpb src/main/java/inra/ijpb].

You can browse the [http://ijpb.github.io/MorphoLibJ/javadoc/ javadoc] for more information about its API.
