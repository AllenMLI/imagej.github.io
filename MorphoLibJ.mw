Collection of mathematical morphology methods and plugins for ImageJ, created at INRA-IJPB Modeling and Digital Imaging lab.

The library implements several functionalities that were missing in ImageJ, and that were not or only partially covered by other plugins. Namely:

* '''Morphological filtering''': erosion & dilation, closing & opening, morphological gradient & Laplacian, top-hat...

* '''Morphological reconstruction''', allowing fast detection of regional or extended extrema, removing of borders, or hole filling

* '''Watershed segmentation''' + GUI, making it possible to segment 2D/3D images of cell tissues

* '''2D/3D measurements''': volume, surface area, inertia ellipse/ellipsoid...

* '''Binary / label images utilities''' for removing or keeping largest connected component, perform size opening, fill holes, kill borders...

== Installation ==

* In ImageJ, download the [https://github.com/ijpb/MorphoLibJ/releases latest released jar] into the ''plugins'' folder.

* In Fiji, you just need to [[How_to_follow_a_3rd_party_update_site#Add_update_sites | add]] the IJPB-plugins site to your list of update sites:

::: 1) Select {{bc | Help | Update...}} from the Fiji menu to start the updater.

::: 2) Click on ''Manage update sites''. This brings up a dialog where you can activate additional update sites.

::: 3) Activate the IJPB-plugins update site and close the dialog. Now you should see an additional jar file for download.

::: 4) Click ''Apply changes'' and restart Fiji.

== Documentation ==
