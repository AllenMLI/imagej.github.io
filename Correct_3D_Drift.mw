This Fiji menu command is implemented by the script [http://fiji.sc/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=fiji.git;a=blob;f=plugins/Scripts/Plugins/Registration/Correct_3D_drift.py;hb=HEAD "Correct 3D Drift"].

1. The script expects the currently open and active image to be a hyperstack consisting of 2D or 3D volumes over time. The script registers the time points to each other using the phase correlation implementation of [[Imglib|ImgLib 1]].

2. Then, a folder is asked for, where the registered time point volumes will be stored.

3. The color channel to use for registration is asked for.

4. After some processing (there are progress bars), the resulting, registered volumes are opened in a virtual hyperstack. They are already saved in the chosen target folder.

The script was written by [[User:Albertcardona|Albert Cardona]] and [http://www.biolsci.monash.edu.au/staff/bryson-richardson/index.html Robert Bryson-Richardson] while attending the [http://cwp.embo.org/pc10-37/ Developmental Imaging EMBO course] organized by [http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/research/photo/556/ Gabriel] [http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/research/unit/51 G. Martins].
