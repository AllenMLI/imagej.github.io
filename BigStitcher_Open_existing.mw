When calling BigStitcher > BigStitcher from the Fiji plugins menu, it will open a macro-scriptable dialog that looks as following:

[[File:BigStitcher_import_exisitng_0.png|center]]

You have several options of how you can select your XML file:
* Drag & drop the XML in there
* Use the filechooser (click Browse ...) to select the XML file
* Type or copy & paste the XML file including its full path

If the XML was successfully recognised, the dialog will change and show a quick summary of the contents of the dataset:

If there was an error parsing the XML or the XML file doesn't exist the dialog will show respective warnings and errors. Finally just click "OK" and the BigStitcher window will appear.
