We have a channel on irc.freenode.net: [irc://irc.freenode.net/fiji-devel #fiji-devel]

If you are unlucky enough not to have an IRC client, or if you are blocked by a restrictive firewall, you can try one of these options instead:
* The [http://webchat.freenode.net/ freenode.net Javascript client]
* Our [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/cgi-bin/cgiirc/irc.cgi CGI::IRC based web-interface]
* A prettier, but closed-source [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/irc.html web interface using mibbit.com technology].
