[[ImageJ]] developers are often available via a couple of different chat services.

== Gitter ==

The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gitter Gitter] chat service, while relatively new, is a great way to discuss programming issues with developers of the [[SciJava]] software stack. All you need is a [https://github.com/ GitHub] account. Advantages of Gitter include a nice "21st century" web interface, email notification when participants miss messages, and a full searchable history.
