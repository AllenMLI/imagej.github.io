We have a chat room (also called channel) on irc.freenode.net: [irc://irc.freenode.net/fiji-devel #fiji-devel].

If Javascript is enabled in your browser, you can connect right away, right here, by entering the captcha and clicking ''Connect'':

<include iframe src="http://webchat.freenode.net?randomnick=1&channels=fiji-devel&uio=d4" width="647" height="400" />

If you are unlucky enough not to have an IRC client, or if you are blocked by a restrictive firewall, you can try one of these options instead:
* The [http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=fiji-devel freenode.net Javascript client] (that is the chat client you see embedded above)
* Our [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/cgi-bin/cgiirc/irc.cgi CGI::IRC based web-interface]
* A prettier, but closed-source [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/irc.html web interface using mibbit.com technology].
