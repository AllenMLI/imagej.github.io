We have a channel on irc.freenode.net: [irc://irc.freenode.net/fiji-devel #fiji-devel]

If you are unlucky enough not to have an IRC client, or if you are blocked by a restrictive firewall, you might want to use our [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/cgi-bin/cgiirc/irc.cgi CGI::IRC based web-interface] or a prettier, but closed-source [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/irc.html web interface using mibbit.com technology].
