Stephan Saalfeld's elastic registration algorithm for serial section microscopy was published in [http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nmeth.2072.html Nature Methods]. The programs implementing the approach are already for a while available in Fiji both as standalone [[Elastic_Alignment_and_Montage|plugin]] and as part of Albert Cardona's [[TrakEM2|TrakEM2]] suite.

The paper is accompanied by number of spectacular videos visulazing the method, evalution and results for electron microscopy and array tomography section series. Check out the movies [http://fly.mpi-cbg.de/elastic here]. Additionally, you can browse through the reconstructed C. elegans dataset (courtesy of Rick Fetter from the Janelia Farm) with [http://fly.mpi-cbg.de/c-elegans CATMAID].

Congratulation to everyone involved, particularly Stephan and Albert.
