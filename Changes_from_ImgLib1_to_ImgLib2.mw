At the Madison hackathon, quite a lot has been done about design issues of the originally published ImgLib (which was already the 6th generation). Unfortunately, these improvements were not possible in a fully backwards-compatible manner.

== Image -> Img ==

In addition to a change from a class to an interface, the name has changed to ''Img'' (which is in line with the library name).

== RandomAccess does not take an OutOfBoundsStrategy any longer ==

TBDBSHK

== The Whole Rest ==

TO BE DONE by someone who knows.
