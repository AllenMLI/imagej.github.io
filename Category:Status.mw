This page collects [[news]] posts describing the '''current status''' of [[ImageJ]]. It is intended to clearly communicate what is going on with ImageJ "at the moment":

* Current best practices for setting up and using ImageJ.
* Current major pitfalls and [[bugs]] in various environments.
* Current issues with ImageJ's online services (e.g., the [[personal update sites]]).

Since ImageJ is actively developed, these details change frequently and this sort of information quickly falls out of date. Therefore, we post each status update with a date stamp, so that you can easily tell the recency of each update.
