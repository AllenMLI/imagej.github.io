{{ambox | text =Most SNT features are triggered by keyboard shortcuts. Shortcuts are typically single keystrokes and do not require other modifier keys to be pressed. Most are highlighted in the user interface. E.g., to toggle the ''<u>H</u>essian analysis'' checkbox, one only needs to press its highlighted letter, i.e., {{key|H}}.
}}

__NOTOC__
==== Interactive Prompt ====

* {{key|Y}} - Confirms the current temporary path. ''Mnemonic: <u>Y</u>es''.

* {{key|N}} - Discards the current temporary path. ''Mnemonic: <u>N</u>o''.

* {{key|F}} - Finishes a path. Note that you can finish a path by pressing {{key|Y}} twice.

* {{key|C}} - Cancels a path. Note that you can finish a path by pressing {{key|N}} twice.

* {{key|Esc}} - Aborts current operation.

==== Tracing ====
* {{key|H}} - Toggles <u>H</u>essian calculation of Path curvatures.

* {{key|I}} - Toggles tracing on filtered <u>I</u>mage.

* {{key|M}} - Finds the brightest voxel (<u>M</u>aximum) above and below the current x,y position and automatically clicks on it. If multiple maxima exist, their average positioning is used. Note that this feature assumes that neurites are brighter than background.

* {{key|S}} - Toggles cursor <u>S</u>napping: If enabled, the plugin will automatically move the cursor to the brightest voxel within the specified x,y,z snapping window<sup>1</sup>. This facilitates accurate [[Simple_Neurite_Tracer:_Accurate_point_placement|positioning of path points]] and it is described in more detail in this [https://github.com/fiji/Simple_Neurite_Tracer/issues/1 issue].

* {{key|Control|Shift}}-click ({{key|Alt|Shift}}-click on MacOS) - Selects a point along the active path to be used as forking point (See [[Simple_Neurite_Tracer:_Step-By-Step_Instructions#Branching:_Start_a_path_on_an_existing_path|step-by-step instructions]] for more details on joining and branching.)

==== Navigation and Zoom ====
* {{key|Shift}} - Synchronizes XY, ZY and XZ views while moving the cursor when not using cursor snapping.

* {{key|+}} - Zooms in (Simultaneously on all views) (IJ default)

* {{key|-}} - Zooms out (Simultaneously on all views) (IJ default)

* {{key|4}} - Displays tracing view(s) at original scale (IJ default)

* {{key|5}} - Displays tracing view(s) at 100% (IJ default)

* {{key|Spacebar}} - Activates the Pan (Hand) tool (IJ default)

* {{key|>}} / {{key|<}} - Previous/Next Z-slice, or Previous/Next channel, depending on the ''Reverse CZT oder of ">" and "<"'' choice set in IJ's {{bc|Edit|Options|Misc..}} prompt (IJ default)

* {{Key|enter}} - Shuttles the window focus between  the tracing image and the SNT window.

==== Path Handling ====
* {{key|A}} - Toggles which traced paths should be displayed: ''<u>A</u>ll'' / ''Selected''.

* {{key|G}} - Selects the nearest path to the mouse cursor. Holding  {{key|Shift|G}} adds the path nearest to the mouse cursor to the current list of selected paths. ''Mnemonic: <u>G</u>roup paths around cursor.''

* {{key|Z}} - Toggles depth-rendering choice of traced paths: ''Parts in nearby slices'' / ''<u>Z-</u>stack projection.

==== Path Editing ====
These shortcuts become available in ''Edit Mode'', activated through the contextual menu (displayed when right-clicking on a tracing canvas):
* {{key|D}} or {{key|Backspace}} - <u>D</u>eletes the active node
* {{key|I}} or {{key|Insert}} - <u>I</u>nserts a new node at cursor position
* {{key|M}} - <u>M</u>oves active node to cursor position
* {{key|B}} - <u>B</u>rings active node to current Z-plane 

==== Legacy 3D Viewer ====
All shortcuts that are not specific to tracing canvases (XY, ZY and XZ views) ''should'' be recognized by the legacy [[Simple_Neurite_Tracer:_3D_Interaction|3D viewer]]. In addition the following are also implemented:
* {{key|H}} - Selects the <u>H</u>and (rotation) tool
* {{key|W}} - Selects the <u>W</u>and (selection) tool
* {{key|Esc}} - Shuttles between the Hand and Wand tool after both have been selected at least once. 

==== Other ====
There are more complex key and mouse combinations used in:
* [[Simple Neurite Tracer: Sholl analysis]]
* [[Simple_Neurite_Tracer:_Step-By-Step_Instructions#Branching:_Start_a_path_on_an_existing_path|Branching and joining paths]]


{{Tip
| tip = SNT was designed so that its shortcuts do not collide with those of ImageJ. SNT hotkeys do not require holding down {{key|Control}} ({{key|Cmd}} on MacOS). When such a modifier key is pressed, the hotkey will no longer be intercepted by SNT. E.g., During a tracing session pressing {{key|S}} will toggle cursor snapping while Pressing {{key|Control|S}} ({{key|Cmd|S}}on MacOS) will allow you to save the traced image using IJ's built-in command {{bc|File|Save}}.
