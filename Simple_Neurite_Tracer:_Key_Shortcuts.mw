{{ambox | text =SNT is mostly a keyboard-based program. Shortcuts are typically single keystrokes and do not require other modifier keys to be pressed. Most are highlighted in the user interface. E.g., to toggle the ''<u>H</u>essian analysis'' checkbox, one only needs to press its highlighted letter, i.e., {{key|H}}.

__NOTOC__
==== Interactive Prompt ====

* {{key|Y}} - Confirms the current temporary path. ''Mnemonic: <u>Y</u>es''.

* {{key|N}} - Discards the current temporary path. ''Mnemonic: <u>N</u>o''.

* {{key|F}} - Finishes a path. Note that you can finish a path by pressing {{key|Y}} twice.

* {{key|C}} - Cancels a path. Note that you can finish a path by pressing {{key|N}} twice.

* {{key|Esc}} - Aborts current operation.

==== Tracing ====
* {{key|H}} - Toggles <u>H</u>essian calculation of Path curvatures.

* {{key|I}} - Toggles tracing on filtered <u>I</u>mage.

* {{key|G}} - Selects the path nearest to the mouse pointer. Holding  {{key|Shift|G}} adds the path nearest to the mouse pointer to the current list of selected paths. ''Mnemonic: <u>G</u>roup paths around pointer.''

* {{key|M}} - Finds the brightest voxel (<u>M</u>aximum) above and below the current x,y position and automatically clicks on it<sup>1</sup>.

* {{key|S}} -Toggles cursor <u>S</u>napping: If enabled, the plugin will automatically move the cursor to the brightest voxel within the specified x,y,z snapping window<sup>1</sup>. This facilitates accurate [[Simple_Neurite_Tracer:_Accurate_point_placement|positioning of path points]] and it is described in more detail in this [https://github.com/fiji/Simple_Neurite_Tracer/issues/1 issue].

* {{key|Control|Shift}}-click ({{key|Alt|Shift}}-click on MacOS) - Selects a point along the active path to be used as forking point (See [[Simple_Neurite_Tracer:_Step-By-Step_Instructions#Branching:_Start_a_path_on_an_existing_path|step-by-step instructions]] for more details on joining and branching.)

==== Navigation and Zoom ====
* {{key|Shift}} - Synchronizes XY, ZY and XZ views while moving the cursor when not using cursor snapping.

* {{Key|enter}} - Shuttles the window focus between  the tracing image and the SNT window.

* {{key|+}} - Zooms in (Simultaneously on all views).

* {{key|-}} - Zooms out (Simultaneously on all views).

* {{key|4}} - Displays tracing view(s) at original scale.

* {{key|5}} - Displays tracing view(s) at 100%.

==== Path Rendering ====
* {{key|A}} - Toggles which traced paths should be displayed: ''<u>A</u>ll'' / ''Selected''.

* {{key|Z}} - Toggles depth-rendering choice of traced paths: ''Parts in nearby slices'' / ''<u>Z-</u>stack projection.

==== Other ====
There are more complex key and mouse combinations used in:
* [[Simple Neurite Tracer: Sholl analysis]]
* [[Simple_Neurite_Tracer:_Step-By-Step_Instructions#Branching:_Start_a_path_on_an_existing_path|Branching and joining paths]]


<sup>1</sup> If multiple maxima exist, their average positioning is used. Note that this feature assumes that neurites are brighter than background.
