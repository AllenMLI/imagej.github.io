===Key Shortcuts===

* {{key|Y}} - Confirm the current temporary path. ''Mnemonic: <u>Y</u>es.''
* {{key|N}} - discard the current temporary path. ''Mnemonic: <u>N</u>o.''
* {{key|F}} - Finish a path. Note that you can finish a path by pressing {{key|Y}} twice.
* {{key|C}} - Cancel a path. Note that you can finish a path by pressing {{key|N}} twice.
* {{key|Esc}} - Abort current operation.
* {{key|G}} - Select the path nearest to the mouse pointer. ''Mnemonic: <u>G</u>roup paths around pointer.''


* {{key|S}} -Toggle cursor <u>S</u>napping: If enabled, the plugin will automatically move the cursor to the brightest voxel within the specified x,y,z snapping window<sup>1</sup>. This facilitates accurate [[Simple_Neurite_Tracer:_Accurate_point_placement|positioning of path points]] and it is described in more detail in this [https://github.com/fiji/Simple_Neurite_Tracer/issues/1 issue].
* {{key|Shift}} - Synchronizes XY, ZY and XZ views while moving the cursor when not using cursor snapping.
* {{key|M}} - Finds the brightest voxel (<u>M</u>aximum) above and below the current x,y position and automatically clicks on it<sup>1</sup>.
* {{key|Control|Shift}}-click ({{key|Alt|Shift}}-click on MacOS) - Selects a point along the active path to be used as branching / ending point (See [[Simple_Neurite_Tracer:_Step-By-Step_Instructions#Branching:_Start_a_path_on_an_existing_path|step-by-step instructions]] for more details on joining and branching.)


* {{key|+}} - Zoom in (Simultaneously on all views).
* {{key|-}} - Zoom out (Simultaneously on all views)
* {{key|5}} - Toggle ''View paths'' choice: ''Parts in nearby slices'' / ''Projected through all slices''. Mnemonic: <u>5</u> is ImageJ's shortcut for "default" view ({{bc|Image|Zoom|View 100%}}).
* {{Key|enter}} - Brings the tracing image/SNT window to front


There are more complex key and mouse combinations used in:
* [[Simple Neurite Tracer: Sholl analysis]]
* [[Simple_Neurite_Tracer:_Step-By-Step_Instructions#Branching:_Start_a_path_on_an_existing_path|Branching and joining paths]]


<sup>1</sup> If multiple maxima exist, their average positioning is used. Note that this feature assumes that neurites are brighter than background.
