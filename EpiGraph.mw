== '''Introduction''' ==
The [[EpiGraph]] is a Fiji plugin that combines computational geometry and graph theory to measure the degree of arrangement in any made by computational or natural tessellation. Here, a tessellation is treated as a network in which the edges are defined by the regions contacts. A network can be splitted up into different subgraphs named graphlets. The comparison of the quantity of each type of graphlets with the reference tessellations provide the Graphlet degree Distribution Distances (GDDs) as a marker of arrangement. This plugin has into account three different reference patterns: a "hexagonal lattice", a "random Voronoi Diagram" (generated Voronoi from seeds located ramdomly) and a "Voronoi Diagram 5" (generated using the Lloyd algorithm at the step 5, beginning from the seeds of the random Voronoi Diagram). They have been used to compute a set of GDDs that quantify organization: GDDH, GDDRV and GDDV5 respectively.

It contains a set of visualization tools, together with graphical user interfaces for easy extraction and analisys of information. The collected data of arrangement can be exported to excel tables for being processed with another tools as well.

On top, to encourage the sharing of resources, [[EpiGraph]] is published under an open-source (GPLv3) license, which can be downloaded from https://github.com/ComplexOrganizationOfLivingMatter/Epigraph/blob/master/LICENSE.

== '''Pipeline''' ==
EpiGraph consists in a pipeline of 5 very simple steps. First, the skeleton of a mosaic image is uploaded and the individual cells are identified.  Second, there is a step where the user selects the distance threshold to identify two cells as neighbours. Here it is possible to select different thresholds and to check the number of neighbours of every cell in each case. Third, a ROI is selected. There are several possibilities such as a default ROI from the image or the selection of individual cells. Fourth, the graphlet information for the selected cells is calculated. These data are used to obtain the GDDH, GDDRV and GDDV5. These values are incorporated to a table. The fifth step includes the classification and labelling of different images in order to represent them in a new window. This final phase allows exporting the representation of the data in a three-dimensional graph. The next videos explain in detail each operation:

== '''Limitations''' ==

Although Epigraph accepts a wide range of images as inputs, we have specified some minimum requirements. It doesnâ€™t accept images bigger than 3000 pixels of width or 3000 pixels of height, since process them could be computationally intensive. In addition, EpiGraph only accepts single images. Stack of images should be adapted to single frames before uploading it to EpiGraph. 
Computers with little RAM memory (less than 16gb) will work but with a series of restrictions. For ensuring the usability, it is not recommended computing images with a high number of cells (more than 1000) due to a possible lack of memory. In the same way, we suggest skeletonizing the edges of the images and using a small radius (lower than 10) to calculate the cells neighbourhood. Choosing an elevated radius value could slow down the work queue, increasing the use of RAM memory. On the other hand, the computers with greater RAM memory will work for more complex images and a wide range of radius. 

If anyone of these requirements are not satisfied, the program alert the user allowing him/her to change the image provided. Importantly, the images and the ROIs require a minimum number of cells in order to get coherent graphlets. 

Regarding the 3D visualization tool, it allows the user to see the position of the samples from different angles. However, the resolution of the exported file is only 72 pixels per inch (dpi). This could be too low for publications and therefore EpiGraph provides an excel table with all the information needed to represent it with other programs.

In summary, we have generated a very accessible open source method to produce a quantitative description of epithelial tissue arrangements. We anticipate that this tool will improve the study of tissue morphogenesis by incorporating the epithelial organization as result of the effect of mutations or diseases.
