The source code of ImageJ is very modular; i.e., it is organized into [[Architecture#Modularity|well-separated]] projects. This separation offers many advantages for efficient software development and it is well worth investing a little bit of time to understand.

== Where is the code? ==
{{Tip | tip=You can search the source code at http://search.imagej.net/ using the GitHub button!}}* All source code is on [[GitHub]]. 
* Each project exists in its own GitHub organization. 
* Each organization contains multiple source code repositories.
* Each repository corresponds to one Java library (.jar file).

See the [[Architecture]] page for more information about the relationship between these projects.

== Building from source ==

Virtually all of these repositories have a top-level <code>pom.xml</code> file, identifying them as [[Maven]] projects.

To build a Maven project:

# [http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html Install Maven].
# Clone the source repository of interest.
# Type <code>mvn</code> from the top-level directory.

Advanced instructions for building, or modifying, the source code are available for specific development environments:

Note that these tutorials are targeted towards [[ImageJ]], but would apply to any Maven-based project.

== Javadocs ==

{{Tip | tip=You can search the javadocs at http://search.imagej.net/ using the Javadoc button!}}You can browse the [http://javadoc.imagej.net/ Javadocs] online.

Each organization has its own [[Git]] repository and [[Jenkins]] job responsible for generating its javadocs:

| {{Javadoc | project = Fiji | label = Fiji}}
| {{GitHub | org = fiji | repo = fiji-javadoc | label = fiji-javadoc}}
| {{Jenkins | job = Fiji-javadoc}}
|}

All SciJava projects use a [https://github.com/scijava/pom-scijava/blob/pom-scijava-5.4.0/pom.xml#L1393-L1418 build-javadoc] profile to standardize configuration for the [http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-javadoc-plugin/ Maven Javadoc plugin]. This allows the Jenkins jobs to aggregate javadoc for their project with its direct Maven dependencies.

== Running ImageJ1 unit tests ==

We have written a substantial number of unit tests to exercise [[ImageJ 1.x]] functionality. See the [[Unit tests for ImageJ1]] page for more information.
