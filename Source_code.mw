{{Development}}
The source code of ImageJ is very modular; i.e., it is organized into [[Architecture#Modularity|well-separated]] projects. This separation offers many advantages for efficient software development and it is well worth investing a little bit of time to understand.

== Source code ==

* All source code is on [[GitHub]]. 
* Each project exists in its own GitHub organization. 
* Each organization contains multiple source code repositories.
* Each repository corresponds to one Java library (.jar file).

{{ ImageJ1 | For ImageJ 1.x source, use the [https://github.com/imagej/ImageJA ImageJA] repository in the ImageJ organization. }}
