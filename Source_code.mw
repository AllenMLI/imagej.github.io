{{Development}}
The source code of ImageJ is very modular; i.e., it is organized into [[Architecture#Modularity|well-separated]] projects. This separation offers many advantages for efficient software development and it is well worth investing a little bit of time to understand.

== Source code ==

* All source code is on [[GitHub]]. 
* Each project exists in its own GitHub organization. 
* Each organization contains multiple source code repositories.
* Each repository corresponds to one Java library (.jar file).

The organizations are:

See the [[Architecture]] page for more information about the relationship between these projects.

== Javadocs ==
You can browse the [http://javadoc.imagej.net/ Javadocs] online.

== Running ImageJ1 unit tests ==

We have written a substantial number of unit tests to exercise ImageJ 1.x functionality. See the [[Unit tests for ImageJ1]] page for more information.
