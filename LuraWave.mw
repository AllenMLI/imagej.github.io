{{FormatsMenu}}If you have Flex files from an older Opera system, you may receive a message from [[Bio-Formats]] stating that you need a LuraWave LWF license code to decode these files.

== Decoding Flex files using the MBF distribution ==

The [[MBF Plugin Collection]] legally bundles the LuraWave LWF decoder module: [http://www.mcmaster.ca/ McMaster University] purchased a redistributable license from LuraTech (see below).

Steps to use:

# [http://imagej.net/download.html Download ImageJ 1.x] and unpack it
# [http://imagej.net/plugins/mbf/ Download the MBF Plugins Collection]
# Merge the MBF plugins into your ImageJ 1.x folder
# Use {{bc | File | Open...}} to convert your .flex files to OME-TIFF using [[Bio-Formats]]

Unfortunately, for legal reasons, we cannot elaborate on the technical details of how the MBF collection provides this functionality, nor can we legally make this feature available within [[ImageJ2]] or [[Fiji]].

== Purchasing your own license ==

Alternately, the LuraWave decoder is proprietary software which you can (theoretically) purchase from [https://www.luratech.com/en/ LuraTech]. However, we do not know the details of who to contact, nor how much it costs to do so.
