== Overview == 

This is the ImageJ/Fiji plugin for [https://github.com/mpicbg-csbd/stardist StarDist], a cell/nuclei detection method for microscopy images with star-convex shape priors.
The plugin can be used to apply already trained models to new images. Currently, it only supports 2D image and time lapse data.
See the [https://github.com/mpicbg-csbd/stardist main repository] for links to our publications and the full-featured Python package that can also be used to train new models. If you encounter problems with the plugin, please file an issue [https://github.com/mpicbg-csbd/stardist-imagej here].

== Installation ==

# Start Fiji (or download and install it from [https://fiji.sc here] first.
# Select <code>Help > Update...</code> from the menu bar.
# Click on the button `Manage update sites`.
# Scroll down the list and tick the checkboxes for update sites <code>CSBDeep</code> and <code>StarDist</code>, then click the <code>Close</code> button. (If <code>StarDist</code> is missing, click <code>Add update site</code> and add it manually with URL https://sites.imagej.net/StarDist.)
# Click on <code>Apply changes</code> to install the plugin.
# Restart Fiji.

== Usage ==

Open the image that should be segmented. Note, that currently only 2D and 2D+time images are supported. Start the plugin with <code>Plugins>StarDist>StarDist 2D</code>. The following parameters can be set:

| Select a neural network model from the dropdown list: this can be either <ul><li> a pretrained model. We currently provide <code>Versatile...</code> and <code>DSB 2018...</code> that were both trained on the [https://data.broadinstitute.org/bbbc/BBBC038/ DSB 2018 nuclei segmentation challenge dataset]<li> a user-trained model ([https://github.com/mpicbg-csbd/stardist via the training code]) that has been exported as zip file or url (specified later on)</ul> ''Additionally one can change/disable the input image normalization if necessary'

| Adjust the postprocessing (Non-Maximum-Suppression NMS) parameter <ul> <li> the higher the ''Object Threshold'' the fewer objects will be selected <li> the higher the ''Overlap Threshold'' the more objects are allowed to overlap </ul> 
It is recommended to load the default NMS parameters of the current model (see below)

| Advanced options <ul><li> Specifying the user-trained model file or URL <li>  Number of tiles (increase if out of GPU memory e.g. for larger images) <li> Load default NMS parameter for the current model (see above)</ul>

After running the plugin, the result will be displayed as label image and as regions in the ROI-manager:
