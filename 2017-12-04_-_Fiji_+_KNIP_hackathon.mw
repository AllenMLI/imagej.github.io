From Monday, December 4, 2017 through Friday, December 15, 2017, the [https://mpi-cbg.de/ Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics] hosts ~50 developers at the [http://www.csbdresden.de/ Center for Systems Biology] in Dresden, Germany for a [[hackathon]] to develop [[ImageJ2]] and [[Fiji]] core infrastructure and [[plugins]].

=== H5, not HDF5 ===

For more info on H5, check out the github repository [https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5/ here].

Perhaps [https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5/issues/15 make it versioned]?  Because ''a duck is not always a duck...''
* feels like HDF5, but stores chunks(blocks) in separate files in the file system.
* is a Java library, but Constantin Pape already wrote a C++/python version of it: z5 (also matches "zarr" library), https://github.com/constantinpape/z5
* attributes are stored in an additional JSON file
* Discussion: should we define standard now as to how data should be stored in there to prevent an emergence of a zoo of different flavors as there is for HDF5?
** how to do time series where each timestep / angle could have different image size
** if we want a general "N5 viewer" for images, we'd have to add calibration data
** put this information around the N5 dataset, because it behaves more like a dataset within an H5 file.
** at least add a version number! Because _a duck is not always a duck..._
* why another file format?
** parallel writes (awesome for clusters with shared filesystem)
** there is a special type for label blocks
** blocks can have a halo
** the block grid does not need to be filled dense, some blocks could be missing
** couldn't this just be another flavor of HDF5?
* are parallel writes to the same block prevented by some kind of locks?
* the HDF5 team should be included in the discussions to learn from their mistakes - there is lots of information on parallel writing of HDF5 files out there
