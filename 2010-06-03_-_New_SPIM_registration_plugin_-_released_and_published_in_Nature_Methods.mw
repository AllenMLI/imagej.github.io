After years of development we release today through the Fiji updater a new plugin for registration of multi-view <b>Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy</b> (SPIM) datasets. Besides the exciting applications for SPIM imaging the code base can be used for efficient matching of large, partially overlapping 3d point clouds. The software was published in [http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v7/n6/full/nmeth0610-418.html Nature Methods]. Details on how to use the plugin for SPIM registration can be found [[SPIM_Registration|here]] and the principle of the algorithm is extensively documented [[SPIM_Registration_Method|here]]. Feedback is very welcome on this brand new Fiji project.
