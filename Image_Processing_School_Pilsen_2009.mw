Fundamentals of image processing: anatomy of a digital image, image formats. Includes notes on image acquisition (effects of dynamic range and exposure times)

Lead instructor: [[Albert Cardona]]

=== Fiji scripting: Python ===

Introduction to Fiji scripting in Python

Lead instructor: [[Johannes Schindelin]]

== Thursday ==

=== Quantitative Imaging ===

Quantitative image acquisition and analysis: Spectroscopy not photography, simple measurements.

The presentation is available online (PDF) [https://info.med.tu-dresden.de/MTZimaging/images/1/1e/QuantitativeColocAnalysis0709small.pdf here!]

Lead instructor: [[Dan White]]

=== TrakEM2 ===

[[TrakEM2]]: image registration and manual segmentation.

Lead instructor: [[Albert Cardona]]

== Friday ==

=== Segmentation ===

Introduction to image segmentation.

*Pixel-based and vector-based.
*Manual and semi-automatic.

Plugins: Simple Neurite Tracer, Segmentation Editor, VIB protocol, TrakEM2, Level Sets.

Lead instructor: [[Verena Kaynig]]

=== Beyond 3D ===

Intensity vs time analysis

Lead instructor: [[JeanYvesTinevez|Jean-Yves Tinevez]]

=== Fiji scripting: advanced Python ===

Advanced Fiji scripting in Python

Lead instructors: [[JeanYvesTinevez|Jean-Yves Tinevez]]

=== Writing Fiji plugins in Java ===

Introduction to Fiji programming in Java (this will be an add-on to the [[#Fiji scripting: advanced Python|advanced scripting]]).

Lead instructor: [[Johannes Schindelin]]

== Saturday ==

=== Registration ===

Image registration: rigid, affine, elastic, maximal warping... ([[Register Virtual Stack Slices]], [[TrakEM2]], [[BUnwarpJ]])

Lead instructor: {{Person|Iarganda}}

== Work sessions ==

At the end of every day, there is time to apply what you learnt and go beyond that.  You can process your own images and discuss results and methods with the instructors.
