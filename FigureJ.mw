}}This plugin allows easy creation of figures for publications, reports, projects.

The idea of FigureJ is to consider '''figure panels as views into datasets'''.

So building a figure should not consist of technical steps, but only selecting data that you want to display.

The software can take care of the rest, and '''guarantee access to the raw data''' and processing history.

Download, installation instructions and video tutorials can be found [https://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/plugin/utilities/figurej/start here.]

When using FigureJ for a research article, you can cite the following [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmi.12069/abstract article from Journal of Microscopy.]
