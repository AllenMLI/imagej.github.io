== Purpose ==
Having LUTs to handle images with more than 3 channels.


== Details ==

[[File:RGB hex.png |400px ]]
[[File:CMY hex.png |400px ]]

[[File:BIOP6Luts hex.png |800px ]]


== On 3 Channels image ==
[[File:3chs_Grays_cell.jpg |600px|3 channels, each in Grays levels. ]]

=== RGB ===
[[File:3chs RGB cell.jpg |800px|3 channels image, in Red Green Blue and Merge. ]]

=== CMY ===
[[File:3chs CMY cell.jpg |800px|3 channels image, in Red Green Blue and Merge. ]]

== On 4 Channels image ==

[[File:4chs Grays cell.jpg |800px|4 channels image, each in Grays levels. ]]

=== Appropriate BIOP-LUTs selection ===
[[File:4chs biop-lut cell ok.jpg |1000px|4 channels image, biop luts good choice]]
===Unappropriate BIOP-LUTs selection ===
[[File:4chs biop-lut cell bad.jpg |1000px|4 channels image, biop luts poor choice]]

Here, channels 2 and 3 are tubular structure and it's difficult to distinguish them if both are greenish.


== Macro Language ==
