== Purpose ==

Having LUTs to handle display of images with more than 3 channels.
Visit [[Color Image Processing]] page to know more about LUTs.

== Details ==
Classical color space are RGB and CMY. Expressed as RGB value, CMY are equal combination of 2 components of RGB, ie  Cyan is obtained by combining Green and Blue in equal proportion.

[[File:CMY hex.png |200px ]]

Here, we propose to use 6 LUTs, which are obtained by combining Red Green and Blue, by two, in different proportion.

== On 3 channels image ==
[[File:3chs_Grays_cell.jpg |600px|3 channels, each in Grays levels. ]]

=== RGB ===
[[File:3chs RGB cell.jpg |800px|3 channels image, in Red Green Blue and Merge. ]]

=== CMY ===
[[File:3chs CMY cell.jpg |800px|3 channels image, in Red Green Blue and Merge. ]]

== On 4 (to 6) channels image ==

[[File:4chs Grays cell.jpg |800px|4 channels image, each in Grays levels. ]]

=== Appropriate BIOP-LUTs selection ===
[[File:4chs biop-lut cell ok.jpg |1000px|4 channels image, biop luts good choice]]
===Unappropriate BIOP-LUTs selection ===
[[File:4chs biop-lut cell bad.jpg |1000px|4 channels image, biop luts poor choice]]

Here, channels 2 and 3 are tubular structure and it's difficult to distinguish them if both are greenish.

== Macro Language ==
<source lang="java">
run("biop-Amber");
run("biop-Azure");
run("biop-BrightPink");
run("biop-Chartreuse");
run("biop-ElectricIndigo");
run("biop-SpringGreen");

== Install ==
You can either use our PTBIOP update site or  [https://imagej.net/_images/b/b0/Biop-luts.zip download biop-luts.zip] and extract to the \luts folder.
