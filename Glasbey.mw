The Glasbey lookup table (LUT) is a color table structured in a maximally discontinuous manner. That is, adjacent color bins are chosen to be as distinct from one another as possible.

Like other LUTs, it is available from the Image > Lookup Tables menu.

== Labelings ==

The Glasbey LUT has numerous uses. It is ideal when coloring a "labeling" of integer-coded regions, since each region will then appear obviously distinct:

== JPEG artifacts ==

Glasbey can also be used to illustrate otherwise-subtle phenomena such as JPEG compression artifacts.

== Publication ==

The Glasbey LUT is based on the publication:

Glasbey, Chris, et al. "[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/col.20327/abstract Colour displays for categorical images]." ''Color Research & Application'' 32.4 (2007): 304-309.
