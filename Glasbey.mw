The Glasbey lookup table (LUT) is a color table structured in a maximally discontinuous manner. That is, adjacent color bins are chosen to be as distinct from one another as possible.

Like other LUTs, it is available from the {{bc | Image | Lookup Tables}} menu.

The LUT called "glasbey" uses white at the first index, whereas "glasbey inverted" starts with black.

== Labelings ==

The Glasbey LUT has numerous uses. It is ideal when coloring a "labeling" of integer-coded regions, since each region will then appear obviously distinct:

== JPEG artifacts ==

Glasbey can also be used to illustrate otherwise-subtle phenomena such as JPEG compression artifacts. Here is a comparison of the Boats sample image before and after being resaved as a JPEG:

== Publication ==

The Glasbey LUT is based on the publication:
