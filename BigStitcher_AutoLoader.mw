== Select to files to include in the dataset ==

In the first window, you can choose which files to include in the dataset.

You can either '''Browse''' for files or directories, drag and drop them to the '''path'''-field or enter a path manually.

To include multiple files in the dataset you can:
* Select a directory as the path - in that case, all files in that directory (except for the ones filtered out by size) will be included.
* Use wildcards in the path. The Automatic loader supports [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming) glob-Syntax]:
** a '*' can be used to specify any sequence of characters
** a '?' can be used to specify a single, varying charcter
All files that match the pattern you enter will be included in the dataset.

As you change the path and wildcards, a preview of the files to be included in the dataset will be displayed:

To prevent the inclusion of small files like operating-system metadata, you can specify a '''minimal size''' for the files to include - smaller files will be ignored (the default of 10KB works fine in most cases).
