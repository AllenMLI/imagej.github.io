== Generate and exploit Kymographs ==


[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kymograph Kymographs] are a way to represent 
on a single image a dynamic process. They are particularly useful to monitor 
in a glimpse a moving organelle and characterize its motion.
They can be seen as a ''x-t'' scan, where the intensity along a given line if plotted
for all images of a stack.  Each time point gives a intensity line, plotted ''e.g.'' along the 
x axis of the kymogrpah. These lines are stacked along the y axis for all frames. 
So we get an image where we move along space in the x direction and along time
in the y direction.

Examples of usage can be found in the references listed at the end of this page.

abstract = {The spindle occupies a central position in cell division as it builds up the chromosome-separating machine. Here we analysed the dynamics of spindle formation in acentrosomal plant cells by visualizing microtubules labelled with GFP-EB1, GFP-MAP4 and GFP-{alpha}-tubulin and chromosomes marked by the vital dye SYTO82. During prophase, few microtubules penetrate the nuclear area, followed by nuclear envelope disintegration. During prometaphase, microtubules invading the nuclear space develop a spindle axis from few bipolar microtubule bundles, which is followed by spindle assembly. Using a novel quantitative kymograph analysis based on Fourier transformation, we measured the microtubule growth trajectories of the entire dynamic metaphase spindle. Microtubules initiating from spindle poles either pass through the metaphase plate to form interpolar microtubule bundles or grow until they reach chromosomes. We also noticed a minor fraction of microtubules growing away from the chromosomes. Microtubules grow at 10 {micro}m/minute both at the spindle equator and at the spindle poles. Photobleached marks created on metaphase and anaphase spindles revealed a poleward tubulin flux. During anaphase, the velocity of tubulin flux (2 {micro}m/minute) equals the speed of chromatid-separation. With these findings we identified spatially coordinated microtubule growth dynamics and microtubule flux-based chromosome-separation as important facets of plant spindle operation.

abstract = {The formation and function of axons depends on the microtubule-based transport of cellular components from their sites of synthesis in the neuronal cell body to their sites of utilization at the axon terminus. To directly visualize this axonal transport in a living organism, we constructed transgenic lines of Caenorhabditis elegans that express green fluorescent protein fused to the monomeric synaptic vesicle transport motor, UNC-104. This UNC-104:: GFP construct rescued the Unc-104 mutant phenotype and was expressed throughout the nervous system. Using time-lapse confocal fluorescence microscopy, we were able to visualize fluorescent motor proteins moving in both directions along neuronal processes, some of which were identified definitely as axons and others as dendrites. Using kymograph analysis, we followed the movement of >900 particles. Most of them moved in one direction, but not necessarily at the same velocity. Ten percent of the observed particles reversed direction of movement during the period of observation, and 10% exhibited periods of movement interspersed with pauses. During episodes of persistent movement, particles moved at an average velocity of 1.02 {micro}m/sec, which is close to the in vitro velocity of microtubule gliding driven by purified monomeric kinesin at high motor density. To our knowledge, this is the first direct visualization and analysis of the movement of specifically labeled microtubule motor proteins along axons in vivo.

In this tutorial, we will see how to generate them and exploit them to study the dynamics of a cellular process.
