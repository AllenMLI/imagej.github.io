ImageJ2's Overlay Manager is fairly similar to the ImageJ 1.x Overlay Manager. See <a href = "http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/menus/analyze.html#manager"> this link </a>.

However there are some major differences between them. For instance:
<ul>
<li>In ImageJ2 overlays are automatically added to the Overlay Manager; they do not need to be selected and added separately.
</ul>
