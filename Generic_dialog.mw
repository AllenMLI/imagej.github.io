The [https://javadoc.scijava.org/ImageJ1/ij/gui/GenericDialog.html Generic Dialog] class is part of ImageJ1 and can be used to make simple graphical user interfaces for scripts and plugins. It requires a bit more of work than with the [[Script Parameters|script parameters]] option but offers more possibilities.<br>
Fiji offers an additional [https://javadoc.scijava.org/Fiji/fiji/util/gui/GenericDialogPlus.html GenericDialogPlus] subclass which include additional GUI item like a file input with a browse button.<br>
Like the script parameters, plugins using the Generic Dialog (or one of its subclass) are macro recordable.

Here is an example in Jython.
<source lang="python">
from ij.gui import GenericDialog

# Create an instance of GenericDialog
GUI = GenericDialog("My first GUI")

# Add some GUI elements (Ok and Cancel button are present by default)
# Elements are stacked on top of each others by default (unless specified)
GUI.addMessage("Some information to display at the top of the GUI")
GUI.addStringField("Type some input text :", "initial text")
GUI.addCheckbox("This is a tickbox->Activate some option", True)

# We can add elements next to each other using the addToSameRow method
GUI.addToSameRow() # The next item is appended next to the tick box
GUI.addChoice("Choose one option among a list", ["Choice1", "Choice2"], "Choice1") # Choice1 is default here

GUI.addNumericField("Some integer", 10, 0) # 0 for no decimal part

# Add a Help button in addition to the default OK/Cancel
GUI.addHelp(r"https://imagej.net/Generic_dialog") # clicking the help button will open the provided URL in the default browser

# Show dialog, the rest of the code is not executed before OK or Cancel is clicked
GUI.showDialog() # dont forget to actually display the dialog at some point


# If the GUI is closed by clicking OK, then recover the inputs in order of "appearance"
if GUI.wasOKed():
    inString = GUI.getNextString()
    inBool = GUI.getNextBoolean()
    inChoice = GUI.getNextChoice() # one could alternatively call the getNextChoiceIndex too
    inNum = Win.getNextNumber() # This always return a double (ie might need to cast to int)
</source>

== Image and file inputs ==
By default, script and plugins process the last selected image.<br>
However sometime one needs to specify different images or files as input.<br>
The subclass [https://javadoc.scijava.org/Fiji/fiji/util/gui/GenericDialogPlus.html GenericDialogPlus] provides a couple of handful methods for such cases, while all methods shown above are inherited from the GenericDialog class.

<source lang="python">
from fiji.util.gui import GenericDialogPlus

# Create an instance of GenericDialogPlus
GUI = GenericDialogPlus("an enhanced GenericDialog")

# Add possibility to choose some images already opened in Fiji
GUI.addImageChoice("Image1","Some description for image1")
GUI.addImageChoice("Image2","Some description for image2")


# The GenericDialogPlus also allows to select files, folder or both using a browse button
GUI.addFileField("Some file path", "DefaultFilePath")
GUI.addDirectoryField("Some folder path", "DefaultFolderPath")
GUI.addDirectoryOrFileField("Some Path", "DefaultPath")

GUI.showDialog()

# Recover the inputs in order of "appearance"
if GUI.wasOKed():
    ImpImage1 = GUI.getNextImage() # This method directly returns the ImagePlus object
    ImpImage2 = GUI.getNextImage()
    
    # Path are recovered as string
    FilePath   = GUI.getNextString()
    FolderPath = GUI.getNextString()
    SomePath   = GUI.getNextString()
</source>
