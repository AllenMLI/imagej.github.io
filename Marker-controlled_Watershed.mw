== Introduction ==
Marker-controlled Watershed is an ImageJ/Fiji plugin to segment grayscale images of any type (8, 16 and 32-bit) in 2D and 3D based on the marker-controlled watershed algorithm (Meyer and Beucher, 1990). This algorithm considers the input  image as a topographic surface (where higher pixel values mean higher altitude) and simulates its flooding from specific seed points or '''markers'''. A common choice for the markers are the local minima of the gradient of the image, but the method works on any specific marker, either selected manually by the user or determined automatically by another algorithm.
== Usage ==

Marker-controlled Watershed needs at least two images to run:
* The '''Input''' image: a 2D or 3D grayscale image to flood, usually the gradient of an image.
* The '''Marker''' image: an image of the same dimensions as the input containing the seed points or markers as connected regions of voxels, each of them with a different label. They correspond usually to the local minima of the input image, but they can be set arbitrarily.
And it can optionally admit a third image:
* The '''Mask''' image: a binary image of the same dimensions as input and marker which can be used to restrict the areas of application of the algorithm. Set to "None" to run the method on the whole input image.
Rest of parameters:
* '''Calculate dams''': select to enable the calculation of watershed lines.
* '''Use diagonal connectivity''': select to allow the flooding in diagonal directions.
Output:
* Labeled image containing the catchment basins and (optionally) watershed lines (dams).

== Installation ==

The Marker-controlled Watershed plugin is part of the [[MorphoLibJ]] library. To install it, you just need to [[How_to_follow_a_3rd_party_update_site#Add_update_sites | add]] the IJPB-plugins update site:

1) Select {{bc | Help | Update...}} from the Fiji menu to start the updater.

2) Click on ''Manage update sites''. This brings up a dialog where you can activate additional update sites.

3) Activate the IJPB-plugins update site and close the dialog. Now you should see an additional jar file for download.

4) Click ''Apply changes'' and restart Fiji.

You should now find the plugin under the sub-menu {{bc | Plugins | MorphoLibJ | Segmentation}}.

'''Note''': Marker-controlled Watershed is only one of the plugins included in the [[MorphoLibJ]] suite. By following these installation steps, you will be installing as well the rest of plugins in the suite.
