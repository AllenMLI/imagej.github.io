The CMP-BIA tools is a package for ImageJ/Fiji performing image segmentation and registration. The package mainly contains user-friendly plugins and also a complex library for further usage (see the [http://github.com/Borda/ij-CMP-BIA GitHub] repository).

All included methods are mainly related to medical imaging but it can be also used in the fields. 

== About us ==

'''Center for Machine Perception''' ([http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/ CMP]) is a university research center performing fundamental and applied research in computer vision, robotics, machine learning, pattern recognition, and mathematics. 

'''Biomedical Imaging Algorithms''' group ([http://www.fel.cvut.cz/vv/tymy/mip.html BIA]) headed by ''[http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~kybic/ doc. Jan Kybic]'' develops new algorithms for biomedical image processing. We process images from different modalities, such as magnetic resonance, ultrasound, computed tomography, or microscopy. We work in 2D, 3D and 4D. We know how to preprocess the data, how to register, segment, model, reconstruct and classify them. We use techniques from image processing, numerical mathematics, as well as machine learning.

== Features ==
* '''''SLIC superpixels''''' - is segmentation tool for clustering regions - superpixels - in given image which are usually used for other segmentation techniques. The only two parameters are average (initial) size of each superpixel and rigidity parameter in range ''<0,1>''.
