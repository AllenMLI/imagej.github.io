'''Critical:''' if you update and Fiji does not work anymore, you need to follow [[Fix_non-functional_Fiji_after_Update_on_MacOSX|these instructions]].

==Installing Fiji==

#Download the .dmg package from the [[Downloads]] page, and then double-click it to open it.
#Create a folder under /Applications/, such as /Applications/Fiji
#Drag the 3 items (Fiji.app, and the plugins and macros symlinks) into the /Applications/Fiji folder.


Fiji is ready to run!

==Running Fiji on Java 1.5 (32-bit)==

Fiji on Mac is running on Java 1.6 (64-bit). If you need to run it in 32-bit mode, use the following code:
 arch -i386 /Applications/Fiji/Fiji.app/Contents/MacOS/fiji-macosx


==Accessing the plugins and macros folders==
To access the plugins or macros folders, set the Finder window to either icons or lists mode, <b>not</b> in column mode, and double-click them.

Alternatively, right-click (or control-click) the Fiji.app and select "Show package contents", to open the folder where the actual plugins and macros folders are.

==Adding new plugins and macros==
Access the plugins folder as explained above and just drag and drop any plugin into the plugins folder, like you would do for ImageJ. Same for macros.
