'''Critical:''' if you update and Fiji does not work anymore, you need to follow [[Fix_non-functional_Fiji_after_Update_on_MacOSX|these instructions]].

==Installing Fiji==

#Download the .dmg package from the [[Downloads]] page, and then double-click it to open it.
#Create a folder under /Applications/, such as /Applications/Fiji
#Drag the 3 items (Fiji.app, and the plugins and macros symlinks) into the /Applications/Fiji folder.


Fiji is ready to run!

==Running Fiji on Java 1.5 (32-bit)==

Fiji on intel Macs runs on Java 1.6 (64-bit). If you need to run it in 32-bit mode, use the following code:
 arch -i386 /Applications/Fiji/Fiji.app/Contents/MacOS/fiji-macosx

== Limited PowerPC (G4/G5) Mac support ==

We offer [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/downloads/Heidelberg/fiji-macosx-ppc-20100802.dmg a special intermediate release of Fiji specific to PowerPC Macs (G4/G5)].

'''Note:''' There is no Java 1.6 for PowerPC from Apple, meaning that Java comes at a considerable performance penalty on this platform. In addition, we will not be able to support Java versions prior to Java 1.6 at some stage, since that version offers a few features we want to rely on, such as [http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2SE/Desktop/scripting/ a versatile scripting framework].

===Advanced===
You can also install a third party Java 6, part of the OpenJDK project. 
You will need a [http://developer.apple.com/opensource/tools/x11.html working X11 server], that you can find on your OS X disk, and MacPorts. 

Execute '''sudo port install openjdk6''' on your Terminal. You can also install the SoyLatte Binaries, as an alternate choice.
Then you can proceed with the generic Fiji Installation

==Accessing the plugins and macros folders==

To access the plugins or macros folders, set the Finder window to either icons or lists mode, <b>not</b> in column mode, and double-click them.

Alternatively, right-click (or control-click) the Fiji.app and select "Show package contents", to open the folder where the actual plugins and macros folders are.

==Adding new plugins and macros==

For plugins, please follow the instructions about [[Installing 3rd party plugins]]. Otherwise, access the plugins folder as explained above and just drag and drop any plugin into the plugins folder, like you would do for ImageJ. Same for macros.

== Installing OpenJDK for MacOSX ==

There is [http://openjdk.java.net/projects/macosx-port/ an Apple-backed effort] to get a proper MacOSX backend into the BSD port of OpenJDK. So far, only Snow Leopard and later are supported, and preliminary builds can be found [http://code.google.com/p/openjdk-osx-build/ here].

If you are experiencing problems, say, with AWT-AppKit related crashes, and if you do not mind working with an X11-based graphical user display, you might want to try OpenJDK.

As of mid-April 2011, OpenJDK for MacOSX has basic working support for Aqua, which you have to activate explicitly by passing the Java option ''-Dswing.defaultlaf=com.apple.laf.AquaLookAndFeel''.

Since the development of OpenJDK for MacOSX is driven exclusively by Apple employees, the minimal MacOSX version required to run OpenJDK/Aqua is 10.6. If you require Fiji to run on earlier versions of MacOSX, you will have to go back to [http://landonf.bikemonkey.org/static/soylatte/ SoyLatte], where you will also find an X11-only OpenJDK version that runs on MacOSX 10.5/PowerPC (MacOSX 10.6+ does not support PowerPC). In the alternative, you can put in a considerable effort to "backport" OpenJDK :-).
