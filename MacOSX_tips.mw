'''Critical:''' if you update and Fiji does not work anymore, you need to follow [[Fix_non-functional_Fiji_after_Update_on_MacOSX|these instructions]].

==Installing Fiji==

#Download the .dmg package from the [[Downloads]] page, and then double-click it to open it.
#Create a folder under /Applications/, such as /Applications/Fiji
#Drag the 3 items (Fiji.app, and the plugins and macros symlinks) into the /Applications/Fiji folder.


Fiji is ready to run!

==Running Fiji on Java 1.5 (32-bit)==

Fiji on intel Macs runs on Java 1.6 (64-bit). If you need to run it in 32-bit mode, use the following code:
 arch -i386 /Applications/Fiji/Fiji.app/Contents/MacOS/fiji-macosx

==No more PPC (G4/G5) Mac support==

Fiji no longer supports PPC Macs (G4/G5) as of the Fiji Heidelberg release (June 2010). We apologize for the inconvenience this might cause for owners of what are now rather antique Macs, but it was just too painful to maintain the platform dependent parts of Fiji. This is partly owing to having ImageJ depending on Java 1.6, and Apple planning not to release this version for the PPC platform. 

==Accessing the plugins and macros folders==

To access the plugins or macros folders, set the Finder window to either icons or lists mode, <b>not</b> in column mode, and double-click them.

Alternatively, right-click (or control-click) the Fiji.app and select "Show package contents", to open the folder where the actual plugins and macros folders are.

==Adding new plugins and macros==
Access the plugins folder as explained above and just drag and drop any plugin into the plugins folder, like you would do for ImageJ. Same for macros.
