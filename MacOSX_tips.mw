'''Critical:''' if you update and Fiji does not work anymore, you need to follow [[Fix_non-functional_Fiji_after_Update_on_MacOSX|these instructions]].

==Installing Fiji==

#Download the .dmg package from the [[Downloads]] page, and then double-click it to open it.
#Create a folder under /Applications/, such as /Applications/Fiji
#Drag the 3 items (Fiji.app, and the plugins and macros symlinks) into the /Applications/Fiji folder.


Fiji is ready to run!

==Running Fiji in 32-bit mode==
{{Warning | 1=It may no longer be possible to start Fiji in 32-bit on recent versions of OS X. See [http://fiji.sc/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1018 this bug report] for details.}}
Fiji on Intel Macs runs on Java 1.6 in 64-bit mode. If you need to run it in 32-bit mode, you can do so as follows:

# Launch Fiji normally, and choose Edit {{arrow}} Options {{arrow}} Memory & Threads.
# Reduce your Maximum Memory setting to ~1800 MB or less.
# Quit Fiji.
# {{key|Ctrl}}+{{key|click}} the Fiji dock icon and choose Options {{arrow}} Show in Finder.
# {{key|Ctrl}}+{{key|click}} on the Fiji application icon that pops up, and choose Show Info (or press {{key|Cmd}}+{{key|I}}).
# Check the "Open in 32-bit mode" box in the Fiji info window.
# Press the red X on the Fiji info window to close it.
# Launch Fiji again, and the status bar should report "[32-bit]" in brackets.

Alternately, you can execute the following code from the Terminal:
 arch -i386 /Applications/Fiji.app/Contents/MacOS/ImageJ-macosx

Either way, you will need to make sure your maximum memory limit is set below ~1800 MB.  If your maximum memory is set higher than the 32-bit limit, Fiji will not be able to start up successfully in 32-bit mode.

== Limited PowerPC (G4/G5) Mac support ==

We offer [http://fiji.sc/downloads/Heidelberg/fiji-macosx-ppc-20100802.dmg a special intermediate release of Fiji specific to PowerPC Macs (G4/G5)].

'''Note:''' There is no Java 1.6 for PowerPC from Apple, meaning that Java comes at a considerable performance penalty on this platform. In addition, we will not be able to support Java versions prior to Java 1.6 at some stage, since that version offers a few features we want to rely on, such as [http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2SE/Desktop/scripting/ a versatile scripting framework].

===Advanced===
You can also install a third party Java 6, part of the OpenJDK project. 
You will need a [http://developer.apple.com/opensource/tools/x11.html working X11 server], that you can find on your OS X disk, and MacPorts. 

Execute '''sudo port install openjdk6''' on your Terminal. You can also install the SoyLatte Binaries, as an alternate choice.
Then you can proceed with the generic Fiji Installation

==Accessing the plugins and macros folders==

To access the plugins or macros folders, set the Finder window to either icons or lists mode, <b>not</b> in column mode, and double-click them.

Alternatively, right-click (or {{key|Ctrl}}+{{key|click}}) the Fiji.app and select "Show package contents", to open the folder where the actual plugins and macros folders are.

==Adding new plugins and macros==

For plugins, please follow the instructions about [[Installing 3rd party plugins]]. Otherwise, access the plugins folder as explained above and just drag and drop any plugin into the plugins folder, like you would do for ImageJ. Same for macros.

== Installing OpenJDK for MacOSX ==

Oracle now supports MacOSX JavaSE 7 [http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Java-SE-7-Update-6-hands-OS-X-support-to-Oracle-1667714.html officially].

It is based on [http://openjdk.java.net/projects/macosx-port/ an Apple-backed effort] to get a proper MacOSX backend into the BSD port of OpenJDK. So far, only Snow Leopard and later are supported, and preliminary builds can be found [http://code.google.com/p/openjdk-osx-build/ here].

If you are experiencing problems, say, with AWT-AppKit related crashes, and if you do not mind working with an X11-based graphical user display, you might want to try OpenJDK.

As of mid-April 2011, OpenJDK for MacOSX has basic working support for Aqua, which you have to activate explicitly by passing the Java option ''-Dswing.defaultlaf=com.apple.laf.AquaLookAndFeel''.

Since the development of OpenJDK for MacOSX is driven exclusively by Apple employees, the minimal MacOSX version required to run OpenJDK/Aqua is 10.6. If you require Fiji to run on earlier versions of MacOSX, you will have to go back to [http://landonf.bikemonkey.org/static/soylatte/ SoyLatte], where you will also find an X11-only OpenJDK version that runs on MacOSX 10.5/PowerPC (MacOSX 10.6+ does not support PowerPC). In the alternative, you can put in a considerable effort to "backport" OpenJDK :-).

== Running Fiji in the command line ==

Often it is necessary to run Fiji in the command line, e.g. to pass some command-line options. To do so, start a Terminal (in the Finder, ''Go>Utilities''), and switch to the correct directory using the ''cd'' command. Note that the application itself is actually a directory called ''Fiji.app''. For example, if you installed Fiji into ''/Applications'' as recommended, do this:

<source lang="bash">cd /Applications/Fiji.app</source>

If you unpacked Fiji onto your desktop, do this:

<source lang="bash">cd $HOME/Desktop/Fiji.app</source>

Once you switched to the correct directory, start the Fiji launcher:

<source lang="bash">Contents/MacOS/ImageJ-macosx</source>

'''Note for Windows users''': A backslash is not the same as a slash. So: ''Contents\MacOS\ImageJ-macosx'' will '''not''' work.

Now you can pass, say, [[Java Options]]:

<source lang="bash">Contents/MacOS/ImageJ-macosx -verbose:gc --</source>

'''Note''': to distinguish between options intended for Java and options intended for ImageJ, you need to separate the former from the latter with a double-dash: '''--'''. Since the default is to accept ImageJ options, you have to pass a trailing double-dash if you want to pass only Java options.

== MacOSX keyboard shortcuts ==

It is often helpful to use keyboard shortcuts when using Fiji. There are also operating system specific shortcuts which can be quite helpful. For example, pressing {{key|Command}}+{{key|Tab}} and releasing first only the {{key|Tab}} key will allow you to cycle through the running applications, while {{key|Command}}+{{key|`}} will do the same for the windows opened by the current application. [http://davespicks.com/ Dave Polaschek] has [http://davespicks.com/writing/programming/mackeys.html a comprehensive list].
