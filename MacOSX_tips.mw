<h2>Installing Fiji</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download the .dmg package from the [[Downloads]] page, and then double-click it to open it.</li>
<li>Create a folder under /Applications/, such as /Applications/Fiji</li>
<li>Drag the 3 items (Fiji.app, and the plugins and macros symlinks) into the /Applications/Fiji folder.</li>
</ol>

Fiji is ready to run!

<h2>Accessing the plugins and macros folders</h2>
To access the plugins or macros folders, set the Finder window to either icons or lists mode, <b>not</b> in column mode, and double-click them.

Alternatively, right-click (or control-click) the Fiji.app and select "Show package contents", to open the folder where the actual plugins and macros folders are.

<h2>Adding new plugins and macros</h2>
Access the plugins folder as explained above and just drag and drop any plugin into the plugins folder, like you would do for ImageJ. Same for macros.
