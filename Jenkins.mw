{{DevelopMenu | tools}}{{Minibox | logo=Jenkins.png | blurb='''Jenkins:''' Serving the ImageJ community, 2010 - 2017!}}ImageJ has a [http://jenkins.imagej.net/ Jenkins server]: a continuous integration system which automatically checks the code for build and test errors.

{{Notice | ImageJ and SciJava projects are in the midst of transitioning to [[Travis CI]] and [[AppVeyor]] for CI services. When this transition is complete, the ImageJ Jenkins server will be retired.}}

The ImageJ Jenkins currently performs a small number of key services:

* [http://jenkins.imagej.net/job/Synchronize-and-deploy-IJ1/ Automatic deployment of ImageJ 1.x] and [http://jenkins.imagej.net/job/ImageJ1-releases/ building of installers for ImageJ 1.x].
* Keeping [https://jenkins.imagej.net/view/Mirrors/ Git repository mirrors in sync].

For an up-to-date list, see the [https://jenkins.imagej.net/view/Active/ list of active Jenkins jobs].
