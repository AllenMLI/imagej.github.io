== Introduction ==
The FLIMJ plugin for ImageJ provides the ability to analyze FLIM data within ImageJ, using the [https://flimlib.github.io/ FLIMLib] library. The plugin can be installed into the [[Fiji]] distribution of ImageJ simply by enabling the FLIMJ [[update site]]. Features include:

* Fit individual pixels, entire images per-pixel, or do global analysis on entire images, using FLIMLib's rapid lifetime determination (RLD), Levenberg-Marquardt (LMA) or global analysis (Global) fitting algorithms
* Single, double and triple exponential fits
* Gaussian, Poisson and Maximum Likelihood Estimation noise models
* Produce one or several fitted images depending which parameters (A, τ, Z, χ²) are chosen for visualization
* Full control over the start and end fit cutoffs known as "cursors"
* Binning options for various kernel sizes to reduce noise and boost intensity when fitting per-pixel
* Support for so-called "excitation" or "prompt" files containing a recorded system response function to be convolved with the exponential fit
* Batch processing support for analyzing many lifetime images as part of a [[scripting]] workflow

== Installation ==

The FLIMJ plugin is available from the "FLIMJ" [[update site]].

Once you have installed the FLIMJ plugin, it becomes available on the menu under {{bc | Analyze | Lifetime | FLIMJ}}.

== Usage ==

=== Startup ===
Open a dataset (such as {{GitHub|org=flimlib|repo=flimj-ops|path=test_files/test2.sdt|label=this one}}) or select an existing image display in Fiji:

[[File:FLIMJ_usage_open_dataset.png]]

With the desired dataset window active, launch FLIMJ from the menu under {{bc | Analyze | Lifetime | FLIMJ}} or search for "FLIMJ" in the search box:

{{Notice | '''FLIMJ plugin accepts only 3- or 4-dimensional datasets.''' If the dataset is opened from a file supported by [[SCIFIO]] (such as a .sdt), the dataset likely has metadata attached, which helps FLIM plugin infer the order of the X, Y, and T axes as well as the time bin size. Otherwise, the user may be asked to provide the information:

[[File:FLIMJ_Lifetime_Axis_Not_Detected.png]][[File:FLIMJ_Time_Base_Info_Not_Detected.png]]

If the dataset comes with a (fourth) spectral dimension, the user has to choose the spectral channel to analyze as well:
