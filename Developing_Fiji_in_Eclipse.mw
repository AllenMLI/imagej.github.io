==Introduction==

[http://www.eclipse.org Eclipse] is a powerful Integrated Development Environment (a so-called ''IDE'') primarily intended to develop Java projects. It is similar to [http://netbeans.org/ NetBeans] and [http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ IntelliJ].

The advantages of using an IDE like Eclipse for developing:

# it is easy to access documentation about classes (i.e. ''javadocs''): just point your cursor over the name of the class and hit ''Shift+F2''.
# you can use code-completion: just type the start of the class name, variable, method, etc you want to use and hit ''Ctrl+Space''.
# compile errors are listed in a concise list; double-clicking on a line in that list will move the cursor to the problem.
# you can debug your program interactively: just open the main class (i.e. a class having a ''public static void main(String[] args)'' method) and go to ''Run>Debug As>Java Application''. This will switch to a different window layout (the ''Debug perspective'') which offers you a range of views that are useful for debugging such as: local variables, thread stack traces, etc. You can interrupt the program at any time by clicking on the ''pause'' symbol and inspect the current state, single-step through the code and even to a limited amount replace code on-the-fly
# the most important version control systems can be accessed easily

Where there are advantages, there are also disadvantages. For example, Eclipse is quite big a program and requires a lot of resources, RAM and screen size in particular.

One other shortcoming -- Eclipse's unwillingness to let the developer specify that the source code is to be packaged into ''.jar'' files automatically -- was fixed by us by using [[Maven]] in conjunction with Eclipse (and luckily Netbeans and IntelliJ support Maven projects, too, so we now really only have to support one way to specify dependencies).

==Install Eclipse==

Install Eclipse using your preferred package manager or download the appropriate binaries of the [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ Eclipse IDE for Java Developers].  Launch Eclipse and decide for a workspace location (e.g. <code>~/worspace</code>).  Usually, current Java works just fine, but for some developers, Eclipse is not stable with Sun/Oracle Java 6.  That is, you will eventually have to install Java 5 as an alternative JRE and make a custom launcher for Eclipse, e.g.

<source lang="bash">
/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun/bin/java -cp /usr/lib/eclipse/startup.jar org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main
</source>

==Install Git==

Install Git using your preferred package manager or download from the [http://git-scm.com/ Git website].

==Checkout Fiji==

Do <span style="color:#ff0000">not</span> clone Fiji into your Eclipse work space. We are using Maven to manage our projects and Eclipse tries very hard to interfer with this when it is allowed to.

<source lang="bash">
cd ~/
git clone git://github.com/fiji/fiji
</source>

This will create the folder ''~/fiji/'' where you have the core Fiji repository (you will initialize your Eclipse work space in ''~/workspace/'' later).

Should you want to work on source code that is not part of the core Fiji repository, you can check out submodules you want to work with. Note: not all repositories we reference in submodules are handled by Maven/

==Create the Eclipse Projects==
Import all Fiji projects via ''File>Import>Maven>Existing Maven Project''. You can point it to Fiji's ''src-plugins/'' directory, it will discover all the projects automatically. The simplest option is to just import all of them.

After finishing this, Eclipse builds the Fiji projects. There should not be any error message but several thousands of warnings that mostly come from Java1.4-style code or not unnecessary imports, variables or methods in the sources of authors who do not use an IDE as Eclipse and thus have no automatic assistance at cleaning up.  All these warnings can be ignored  having not effect to the functionality of the code.

==Add a Run Configuration==
[[Image:Screenshot-Run.png|thumb|New Run Configuration|300px]]
Fiji can be launched conveniently from inside Eclipse.  For this purpose, create a new Run Configuration (Run -> Run Configurations...)
<dl>
<dt>Main
<dd>
;Project: fiji
;Main class: fiji.Main
<dt>Arguments
<dd>
;VM arguments: <nowiki>-Xms3000m -Xmx3000m -Dplugins.dir=</nowiki>'''<project-directory>/target/'''
;Working directory: Other: ${system_property:user.home}/Desktop/
<dt>JRE
<dd>
;Runtime JRE: Alternate JRE: Fiji Java
;Java executable: Default (javaw)
</dl>

Note: you need to set the plugins.dir property to the ''.jar'' file which was generated in the ''target/'' subdirectory of the project you want to debug. Otherwise ImageJ 1.x will not find the plugins. Example: to debug the [[3D Viewer]], you'd need ''-Dplugins.dir=${system_property:user.home}/fiji/3D_Viewer/target/'' as VM argument.

==Alternative to a Run Configuration==

Instead of jumping through a lot of hoops to make sure that the ''plugins.dir'' property is set correctly using a totally manual method, we can ask Fiji to do it for us. It is enough to add a ''main()'' method like this to the class implementing the plugin and use the default Run Configuration (just right-click in the ''main()'' method and select either ''Run As>Java Application'' or ''Debug As>Java Application''):

<source lang="java">
import fiji.Debug; // requires fiji-lib as a dependency

[...]

public static void main(String[] args) {
    // requires a plugins.config in src/main/resources/ that has a line like:
    // Plugins, "My shiny new plugin", the.current.PluginClass
    Debug.run("My shiny new plugin");
}
</source>

To debug classes of type ''PlugInFilter'', use the ''Debug.runFilter(imagePath, plugin, parameters)'' method instead.

Note: if you do not require ImageJ 1.x to really know about your plugin (i.e. it does not have to show up in the menus for the testing/debugging to work), you can also do something like this instead:

<source lang="java">
public static void main(String[] args) {
    new ImageJ();
    ImagePlus image = IJ.openImage("/path/to/fiji/samples/clown.jpg");
    IJ.runPlugIn(image, "fiji.My_Beautiful_Plugin", "parameter=Hello");
    image.show();
    WindowManager.addWindow(image.getWindow());
}
</source>
