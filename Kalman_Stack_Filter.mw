== Purpose ==

This plugin implements a recursive prediction/correction algorithm which is based on the Kalman Filter  to remove high gain noise from stacks. It is very useful for noisy time-lapse movies.

== Documentation ==

The [http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/kalman.html ImageJ website] offer a very complete documentation for its usage. Please refer to it.
