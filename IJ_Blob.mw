== Purpose ==
The IJBlob library indentifying connected components in binary images. The algorithm used for connected component labeling is:

''Chang, F. (2004). A linear-time component-labeling algorithm using contour tracing technique. Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 93(2), 206â€“220. doi:10.1016/j.cviu.2003.09.002''

A connected component is a set of pixels which are connected by its 8-neigherhood and is often called a "blob". An Example:

IMAGE

The image above contains 8 marked blobs. Also the holes (and the contours of the holes) of the two Bs and the O are identified. It is also possible to get a color labeled image:

In addition ijblob identifies nested objects:
