'''Alexander Krull''' developed a [[Low_Light_Tracking_Tool|low light tracking tool]] while working in [http://www.mpi-cbg.de/en/research/research-groups/iva-tolic-norrelykke.html '''Iva Tolic-Norrelykke'''] lab at MPI-CBG.

The software is a tool for the tracking of low-light sub-resolution objects in fluorescent microscopy, but it can be applied in other fields as well. The plugin implements the localization algorithm described in the following paper: 

Krull, A., Steinborn A., Ananthanarayanan V., Ramunno-Johnson D., Petersohn U., Tolic-Norrelykke I. M.
'''A divide and conquer strategy for the maximum likelihood localization of low intensity objects.'''
''Opt. express'', 22, no. 1, pp. 210-228, (2014)

As usual it is available through its own [[List_of_update_sites|update site]].
 
Thanks to Alex for this great work and Iva for being such a steadfast supporter of Fiji.
