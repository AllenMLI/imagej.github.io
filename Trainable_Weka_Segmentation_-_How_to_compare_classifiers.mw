=== Introduction ===
In this tutorial we will show how to compare the performance of different classifiers in the same segmentation problem using the [[Advanced Weka Segmentation]] plugin. Most of the information of this tutorial has been extracted from the [http://iweb.dl.sourceforge.net/project/weka/documentation/3.7.x/WekaManual-3-7-3.pdf WEKA manual for version 3.7.3], chapter 6.

=== Starting the plugin ===
To get started, open the 2D image or stack you want to work on and start up the Advanced Weka Segmentation plugin:

For this tutorial, we used one of the TEM sections from [[public data sets | Albert Cardona's public data set]].

After loading, the main GUI of the plugin will pop up:

=== Gathering training samples ===
First of all, we select the features (filters) that we want to use to perform the segmentation. For that, we will click on "Settings", select the corresponding features on the Settings dialog, and click "OK":

After that, we use the selection tools to trace samples of both classes. By default, the "freehand" line is selected, but you can use any of the available selection tools to mark areas on the image and then add them to any of the classes by click on the "Add to class [1/2]" buttons. In our example, we use the two classes to differentiate between membrane areas (in red, class 1) and the rest of the image (in green, class 2):
