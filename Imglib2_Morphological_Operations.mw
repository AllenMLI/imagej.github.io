This page centralizes documentation and current performance of the morphological operation package in imglib2. As the package is under development, the information here might be irrelevant or useless</tt>


== Diamond structuring element ==

This structuring element can be exactly decomposed in a series of smaller diamond and diamond tips, as proposed in [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/1049965292900553.htm Rein van den Boomgard and Richard van Balen, Methods for Fast Morphological Image Transforms Using Bitmapped Binary Images, CVGIP: Models and Image Processing, vol. 54, no. 3, May 1992, pp. 252-254.]

Here is a comparison on how the decomposed version performs versus the non-decomposed one.


== Rectangular structuring element ==

=== 2D case ===

If the image has <code>M</code> pixels, and that the rectangle is a square of side 
<code>R</code>, then the non-optimized case should have a processing time proportional to <code>M × R²</code>. The optimized case replace iterating over the square by iterating twice over a line of length <code>R</code>. Therefore its processing time should be proportional to <code> 2 × M × R</code>. 

The performance improvement should therefore be equal to <code>R / 2</code>. A linear fit of the actual curve rather shows that the law is <code> 0.73 × R + 0.37</code>. This extra benefit - I don't why it's there. 

=== 3D case ===

Here the standard case takes a time proportional to <code>M × R³</code>, and the optimized case a time proportional to <code> 3 × M × R</code>. Therefore the performance ratio should be  <code>R² / 3</code>. A fit shows that this ratio follows <code>0.63 × R² + 0.57 × R + 0.48</code>.
