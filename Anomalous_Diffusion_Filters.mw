== Anomalous Diffusion Filters ==

A PlugInFilter for the two different methods for image filtering: Anisotropic Anomalous Diffusion and Isotropic Anomalous Diffusion. Both methods description can be found in the Physics in Medicine and Biology article [http://] and have a discrete solution of generalized diffusion heat equation (also know as a porous media equation). 

In summary, the anomalous diffusion filters are generalized methods that are proposed using the new anomalous distribution probability function (PDF) paradigm, also called ''q-Gaussian'' PDF. These new filters are capable to build both classic and anomalous diffusion process, which is related to the anomalous parameter, called q value. When q=1 it returns the classic diffusion methods, both anisotropic diffusion (Perona and Malik method) and Gaussian filter (usual Gaussian filter widely knows in several filtering applications). On the contrary, when q â‰  1 the anomalous diffusion filters uses the q-Gaussian probability distribution to attenuate the local noise present in each neighborhood around each pixel of the image.

'''Update notes:'''

*''Feb-01-2015'': The methods are capable to process image stacks, however, all the filtering method still is performed in bidimensional images.
