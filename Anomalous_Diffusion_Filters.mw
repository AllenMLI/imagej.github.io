== Anomalous Diffusion Filters ==

A PlugInFilter for the two different methods for image filtering: Anisotropic Anomalous Diffusion and Isotropic Anomalous Diffusion. Both methods description can be found in the Physics in Medicine and Biology article [http://] and have a discrete solution of generalized diffusion heat equation (also know as a porous media equation). 

In summary, the anomalous diffusion filters are generalized methods that are proposed using the new anomalous distribution probability function (PDF) paradigm, also called ''q-Gaussian'' PDF. These new filters are capable to build both classic and anomalous diffusion process, which is related to the anomalous parameter, called q value. When q=1 it returns the classic diffusion methods, both anisotropic diffusion (Perona and Malik method) and Gaussian filter (usual Gaussian filter widely knows in several filtering applications). On the contrary, when q â‰  1 the anomalous diffusion filters uses the q-Gaussian probability distribution to attenuate the local noise present in each neighborhood around each pixel of the image.

'''Update notes:'''

*''Feb-01-2015'': The methods are capable to process image stacks, however, all the filtering method still is performed in bidimensional images.

== Anomalous Diffusion Analytic Description ==

Anomalous diffusion processes (ADP) are mathematically denoted by a power law in the Fokker-Planck equation, leading to the generalized form. There are several generalizations of the Fokker-Plank equation, which should give many different partial differential equations (PDEs). Here we adopt only the so called porous media form, allowing the super-diffusive and the sub-diffusive processes. In porous media, channels are created promoting or blocking the flow of the density function. Equation (\ref{Eq:FokkerPlanckGeneralized}) shows the generalized heat flow equation that is the main PDE equation for the anomalous diffusion paradigm.

\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} =   \overrightarrow{\nabla}[D_q .\overrightarrow{\nabla} \rho]^{2-q}

Where <math>\rho</math> represents diffusing element concentration, <math>D_q</math> denotes the generalized diffusion coefficient and $q$ is the power law parameter conveniently written. When <math>q=1</math>, the porous media equation recovers the classical diffusion, for <math>q<1</math> it represents sub-diffusive process, and when <math>q>1</math> it means super-diffusive phenomena are present. The <math>D_q</math> is the diffusion coefficient function that regulates diffusibility. We can distinguish <math>D_q</math> function in isotropic: when the diffusion coefficient is the same for all direction, i.e. <math>D_q</math> is direction invariant; and anisotropic behavior: when diffusion is driven to specific directions. The definition of isotropy or anisotropy is directly related to <math>D_{q}</math> function, which is the spatial function that regulates the filter blurring effect at each point.

The generalized diffusion coefficient value, <math>D_q</math>, must be consistent with ADP so that it can be used in IAD and AAD filters. The analytical form for <math>D_q</math> must be consistent with the ADP time evolution of variance, which follows <math>\sigma^{2} = 2.D_q.t</math>, i.e. linear relationship for classical diffusion, and <math>\sigma^{2} \propto t^{2/(3-q)}</math>, i.e nonlinear relationship for ADP.
