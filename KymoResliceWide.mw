This plugin builds [[Generate_and_exploit_Kymographs|kymographs]] using straight line, polyline or freehand selection of variable thickness (and using either average or maximum intensity across the line). So it is extended implementation of ImageJ's ''Reslice'' function. Here are some thought on "[http://katpyxa.info/feedbacks/?p=26 Why another kymograph plugin?]".

== Using plugin == 

Open the stack/movie to be analyzed in ImageJ. Draw a line along the area where you want to make a kymograph.<br />You can use ImageJâ€™s ''native'' '''embedded''' characteristics of the line/curve, like: 

=== Line type === 

Plugin automatically picks up your choice of line selection from ImageJ and corrects for its length.<br />Just use the one you need.

=== Line width ===

Define the width of line using double click on the line selection tool in ImageJ

=== Parameters ===

After that the window showing kymograph parameters will pop-up:

Where following options are available (in order): 
* whether to take average or maximum intensity transverse to line; 
* (unchecked) time as y-axis, distance as x-axis, (checked) time as x-axis, distance as y-axis; 
* (checked) curve will be added and displayed in the overlay of original movie/stack to mark already analyzed region.

== Other kymograph plugins == 

As alternative, there is very well documented [[Multi Kymograph]] plugin and its updated version [http://biop.epfl.ch/TOOL_KYMOGRAPH.html Kymograph tool].
