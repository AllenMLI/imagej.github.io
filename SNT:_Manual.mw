===Cursor Auto-snapping===
If active (the default) the cursor snaps to the brightest voxel in its vicinity. To accomplish this, SNT takes the cuboid of the specified dimensions (in pixels) centered on the current cursor position and searches quickly for local maxima in that neighborhood, moving the cursor to that position. The Z-plane in which the maximum was found is automatically selected if the "Z" parameter is greater than 0. Noteworthy:
* This feature assumes the signal is brighter than the background as typically found in fluorescent images.
* If multiple maxima exist (e.g., when the signal is saturated), it snaps to their centroid.[[File:cursor-snap.png|right|border]]
* To streamline the computation:  XYZ dimensions are constrained to even numbers and limited range.
* Snapping occurs in 2D (i.e., in the active plane) if Z=0.
* The XZ, ZY views are synchronized when 3D snapping is active (i.e., Z>0).

===Tracing on Filtered Image===
SNT's "Hessian-based analysis" option for filtering for tube-like structures is a quick way of improving the efficiency and accuracy of path-finding. However, if your data requires tailored pre-processing, you may also choose to trace on a user-specified filtered image. For example, one might use Frangi et al.'s method to enhance vessel-like structures.
====A Single Image====
To process a single image, load your image ("test.tif", say) into Fiji and select {{bc | Process | Filters | Frangi Vesselness}}.  (There is more information about this plugin [[Frangi|on its page]].)  By way of example, let's say that you select two scales, from twice the x voxel separation to five times that value. We apply a Gaussian convolution at each scale. Assuming your image has isotropic resolution, the parameters would look like this.

Save the result by doing {{bc | File | Save As}} with the same extension as the original image ("test-filtered.tif", for example). Then, with SNT open, go to the main dialog tab and look for "Tracing on Filtered Image". Click "Browse" to load the filtered image, select "SNT" for the parser and press "Load". Finally, toggle the "Trace on filtered Image" checkbox. Now the path-finding will occur on the filtered image.

To display the image, from the SNT dialog go to {{bc | View | Show Filtered Image}}

====Preprocess Multiple Images====

The easiest way to preprocess multiple images is to record a macro for processing a single images, and then wrap it it in a loop to iterate over all the files in a directory.  For example:

<source lang="java">
d = getDirectory("Select a directory");
files = getFileList(d);

extension = ".tif";

for( i = 0; i < files.length; ++i ) {
    filename = files[i];
    if( endsWith(filename,extension) ) {
        l = lengthOf(filename);
        el = lengthOf(extension);
        basename = substring(filename,0,l-el);
        expected_window_name = "vesselness of "+filename;
        output_filename = d + File.separator + basename + ".tubes.tif";
        open(filename);
        run("Frangi Vesselness (imglib, experimental)", "number=1 minimum=0.288387 maximum=0.288387");
        selectWindow(expected_window_name);
        saveAs("Tiff", output_filename);
    }
}
