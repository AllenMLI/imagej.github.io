==Main Tab==
This home tab aggregated widgets for tracing and frequent operations.

===Cursor Auto-snapping===
'''Enable Snapping checkbox''' If active (the default) the cursor snaps to the brightest voxel in its vicinity (Toggling shortcut: {{Key|S}}). To accomplish this, SNT takes the cuboid of the specified dimensions (in pixels) centered on the current cursor position and searches quickly for local maxima in that neighborhood, moving the cursor to that position. The Z-plane in which the maximum was found is automatically selected if the "Z" parameter is greater than 0. Noteworthy:
* This feature assumes the signal is brighter than the background as typically found in fluorescent images.[[File:cursor-snap.png|right|border]]
* If multiple maxima exist (e.g., when the signal is saturated), it snaps to their centroid.
* To streamline the computation:  XYZ dimensions are constrained to even numbers and limited range.
* Snapping occurs in 2D (i.e., in the active plane) if Z=0.
* The XZ, ZY views are synchronized when 3D snapping is active (i.e., Z>0).

===Auto-tracing===
[[File:SNT-auto-tracing.png|right|thumb]]
'''Enable A* search algorithm''' By default, SNT uses the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm A* search] to automatically trace paths between two manually selected points. To manually place nodes in a path, toggle this feature off. Note that it is also possible to enable other algorithms through the installation of SNT addons. See [[SNT: Tubular Geodesics|Tubular Geodesics]] for details.

'''Hessian-based analysis''' (Toggling shortcut: {{Key|H}}) A quick way to improve the quality and efficiency of the pathfinding is to enable this feature, in which paths are computed after filtering the image for tube-like structures. Upon such filtering, SNT will use a measure of [[Tubeness]] at each point of the image to define the best path through it, based on eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hessian_matrix Hessian matrix]. The later can be used to infer the likelihood that a point in the image belongs to a tube-like structure. This concept is also known as ''vesselness'' or ''neuriteness''.

'''Hessian options''' (Specified in the ''gear'' drop-down menu) may be chosen ''Manually'' (if you already have a quantitative understanding of the image) or ''Visually'' (generally more intuitive). Hessian analysis requires two parameters to be specified:
* '''Sigma''' Controls the spatial scale of the filter. A  lower ''sigma'' (σ) will capture small scale structure but is more sensitive to noise. A larger σ will consider larger scale structures but is less sensitive to local shape characteristics. It is generally advised to pick a value which reflects the average radius of the structures to be traced. It corresponds to the standard deviation of the 3D Gaussian kernel used to smooth the image prior to ''Tubeness''  filtering
* '''Maximum''' The maximum pixel intensity on the ''Tubeness'' image beyond which the cost function for A* search is minimized.
If you choose ''Visually'', the dialog will prompt you to click on a representative region of the image which has meaningful structure. Once you click there, a 9-square palette is generated showing increasing values of sigma (from top-left to bottom-right) applied to that region of the image. The palette is an image stack which can be scrolled through with the mouse wheel.

Also, note how lower sigma values cause the axon to be dimmer on the center and brighter on the edges, while higher sigma values eliminate detail from the structure.
|-
|}
</center>

Experiment with different ''Adjusted max.'' values to find a setting which captures the structures you are interested in while taking care to avoid over or under-saturation. In the former case, the search might consider pixels outside of the tubular structures, giving a less accurate result. In the latter case, the search might take significantly longer, since each pixel will carry greater cost than is reasonable. It is usually safe to choose a value somewhere near the default. Once you have chosen this value, click on the square in the palette with the sigma that best fits your application (its border will turn green) then press "Apply". The parameters will be transferred to the interface and a Gaussian convolution will be run over the image, which may take some time depending on its size. Once it's done, pathfinding will occur on the Hessian (a.k.a. ''Tubeness'') image.

Other options are also available in the ''gear'' drop-down menu:
* '''Cache All Hessian Computations''' By default SNT computes the Hessian matrix on a "compute-as-you-go" basis, which saves memory but increases the pathfinding time. If you have enough RAM, you can use this option to compute once the matrix and for the full image and cache the result, which in certain cases, can lead to almost-instantaneous searches. Note that this computation adopts the current values of sigma and max. reported in the widget, so you should adjust those before running this command.

* '''Flush Cached Data''' Removes cached data from memory
* '''Load Precomputed "Tubeness Image"''' This (advanced) option prompts you to load a file of a ''Tubeness image'' generated elsewhere. This is useful if e.g., you want to experiment algorithms from other software packages, or your own. Note that loaded image is assumed to have compatible dimensions with the image currently being traced.
* '''Show Cached "Tubeness Image"''' Displays the ''Tubeness'' data currently cached. Useful for debugging purposes. Also mirrored in {{bc | View | Show Cached/Loaded Hessian (Tubeness) Image}}.
[[File:original-hessian-side-by-side.png|center|thumb|600px|Original (left) and Hessian (right)]]

===Tracing on Filtered Image===
SNT's "Hessian-based analysis" option provides a convenient and easy way to preprocess your data. However, if your data require tailored preprocessing, you may also trace on a user-specified filtered image. For example, one might use the [https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%252FBFb0056195.pdf Frangi et al. 1998] method to enhance vessel-like structures in the image.
====A Single Image====
To process a single image with the Frangi Vesselness filter, load it ("test.tif", say) into Fiji and select {{bc | Process | Filters | Frangi Vesselness}}.  (There is more information about this plugin [[Frangi|on its page]].)  By way of example, let's say you select two scales, twice the x voxel separation and five times that value. We apply a Gaussian convolution at each scale. Assuming your image has isotropic resolution with pixel width = pixel height = pixel depth = 1, the parameters would be:
[[File:frangi-parameters.png|center|thumb|Frangi parameters]]
Save the result by doing {{bc | File | Save As}} with the same extension as the original image ("test-filtered.tif", for example). Then, with SNT open, go to the main dialog tab and look for the "Tracing on Filtered Image" widget. Click "Browse" to load the filtered image, select "SNT" for the parser and press "Load". Finally, toggle the "Trace on filtered Image" checkbox. Now the pathfinding will occur on the filtered image.
<div align="center">
<ul> 
<li style="display:inline-block;"> [[Image:filtered-image-load.png|none|thumb|300px|Step 1]] </li>
<li style="display:inline-block;"> [[Image:filtered-image-toggle.png|none|thumb|300px|Step 2]] </li>
</ul>
</div>
To display the image in a separate window, from the SNT dialog go to {{bc | View | Show Filtered Image}}
[[File:display-filtered-image.png|center|thumb|500px|Side-by-side original and filtered images]]

====Preprocess Multiple Images====

The easiest way to preprocess multiple images is to record a macro for processing a single image, then wrap it in a loop to iterate over all files in a directory. For example:

<source lang="java">
d = getDirectory("Select a directory");
files = getFileList(d);

extension = ".tif";

for( i = 0; i < files.length; ++i ) {
    filename = files[i];
    if( endsWith(filename,extension) ) {
        l = lengthOf(filename);
        el = lengthOf(extension);
        basename = substring(filename,0,l-el);
        expected_window_name = "vesselness of "+filename;
        output_filename = d + File.separator + basename + ".tubes.tif";
        open(filename);
        run("Frangi Vesselness (imglib, experimental)", "number=1 minimum=0.288387 maximum=0.288387");
        selectWindow(expected_window_name);
        saveAs("Tiff", output_filename);
    }
}
</source>

===Filters for Visibility of Paths===

By default, the entire path is projected onto the current Z-slice. This is useful to see how much has been completed and gives a sense of the overall structure of the reconstruction. However, SNT provides 3 additional visibility options for paths:
[[File:Path-visibility-filters.png|right|thumb|"Filters for visibility of paths" widget]]
# '''Only selected paths (hide deselected)''' Only show paths that have been manually selected in the Path Manager or with the {{Key|G}} key ({{Key|Shift}}+{{Key|G}} to select multiple paths).
# '''Only nodes within X nearby Z-slices''' Only highlight nodes within X number of Z-slices on either side of the current slice. The projected skeletons of all paths remain visible.
# '''Only paths from active channel/frame''' If tracing on a multichannel image or an image with a time axis, only show paths from the active channel or frame.
Any combination of these options may be toggled simultaneously.

===Default Path Colors===
[[File:Default-path-colors.png|right|thumb|300px|]]
[[File:CMYK-color-model.png|right|thumb|300px|CMYK color selection UI]]
By default, finished paths are colored by their selection status (only selected paths can be edited, or extended). The default colors are <font color="#00FF00">Green</font>  (selected paths) and <font color="#FF00FF">Magenta</font>  (deselected). Default colors can be customized by pressing the respective button in the widget and using the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK_color_model CMYK color chooser]. For customizing unconfirmed and temporary paths, see the ''Colors'' option in the [[#UI_Interaction|UI Interaction]] widget.

'''Enforce default colors (ignore color tags)''' If active, SNT will force all paths to conform to the default "Selected" and "Deselected" color buttons. Any custom color tags will be ignored until the option is toggled off.

{{Tip| id = coloring-paths|tip = The [[#Path Manager|Path Manager]] offers several ways to colorize Paths: 1) Using {{bc | Tag | Color}} swatches (custom colors can be temporarily assigned to empty swatches, by right-clinking on them) or 2) Using {{bc|Analyze|Color Coding}}, providing morphometric-based [[SNT:_Overview#Analyze|color mapping]]. Note that Path Manager commands are applied to all paths if no no path(s) are selected.

==Options Tab==
This tab aggregated widgets for advanced settings.

===Data Source===
[[File:SNT-data-source-widget.png|right|thumb|"Data Source" widget]]
If tracing on a multi-dimensional image (i.e., one with multiple data channels and/or a time axis), a particular channel/frame can be loaded into the views by selecting each and pressing the "Reload" button.

===Views===
[[File:SNT-views-widget.png|right|thumb|]]
* '''Overlay MIP(s) at X% opacity''' Overlays the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_intensity_projection Maximum Intensity Projection] of the image "over" the image canvas at the specified opacity. Overlaid projection is only used as a visualization aid and is ignored by the auto-tracing algorithms. It is rendered using the LUT of the channel currently being traced. To reload the overlay (e.g., in case the image being traced changes during a tracing session) toggle the checkbox twice.
{{clear}}
<div align="center">
<ul> 
<li style="display:inline-block;"> [[Image:OP1-without-MIP.png|none|thumb|250px|Image without MIP overlay]] </li>
<li style="display:inline-block;"> [[Image:OP1-with-MIP.png|none|thumb|250px|Image with MIP overlay at 30%]] </li>
</ul>
</div>
* '''Draw diameters in XY view''' Displays the stored diameter (if any) in the XY view for all existing nodes. Each diameter is drawn as a line segment with length = diameter, which is bisected by the orthogonal tangent vector to the path at that node.
<div align="center">
<ul> 
<li style="display:inline-block;"> [[Image:Draw-diameters-disabled.png|none|thumb|200px|Draw diameters - disabled]] </li>
<li style="display:inline-block;"> [[Image:Draw-diameters-enabled.png|none|thumb|200px|Draw diameters - enabled]] </li>
</ul>
</div>
* '''Apply zoom changes to all views''' If a zoom change is applied to any one of the XY, ZY or XZ views, apply the same change to the two other views if they are open. Since in ImageJ zooming may resize the image window, you can use {{bc|Views|Arrange Views}} to reset their positions
* '''Resize Canvas''' If using a display canvas to view reconstructions, reset its dimensions to the default. (Currently, this command is only available for display canvases, to resize an image go to IJ's command {{ bc | Image | Adjust | Canvas Size...}}
* '''Display ZY/XZ views''' If currently using the XY only view, display the ZY and XZ views as well.

===Temporary Paths===
[[File:SNT-temporary-paths-dialog.png|right|thumb|"Temporary Paths" widget]]
* '''Confirm temporary segments''' If active, prompts for either confirmation or denial of whether or not to keep an unconfirmed path segment. If inactive, automatically confirms the path segment created on each left-click after starting a path (first click). Applies to both auto-traced and manually traced path segments. The following two settings are only toggle-able when this setting is active.
** '''Pressing 'Y' twice finishes path''' Finish a temporary path on two successive {{key|Y}} key presses.
** '''Pressing 'N' twice cancels path''' Discard a temporary or unconfirmed path, including the start node, on two successive {{key|N}} key presses.

===UI Interaction===
[[File:SNT-UI-interaction-widget.png|right|thumb|]]
* '''Colors''' Specifies how components should be rendered, including:
**'''Canvas annotations''' The label shown on the top-left corner of the views indicating the state of the UI ("Tracing Paused", "Choosing Sigma", etc.)
**'''Fills''' The pixels that have been reached by the Fill search
**'''Unconfirmed''' and '''Temporary''' paths.
* '''Path nodes rendering scale''' (default scale is inferred from current zoom level) Adjusts the radius of the circles representing path nodes. A path node is rendered as a circle centered at the XYZ coordinate of the point annotation.
* '''Activate canvas on mouse hovering''' If active, moving the mouse cursor over the any of the views automatically brings the view window into focus, allowing it to receive input.

===Misc===
* '''Skip confirmation dialogs''' If active, forgoes the ''Are you sure?'' prompt preceding major actions. Note that this option does not apply to irreversible actions such as deleting paths.
* '''Debug mode''' If active, logs detailed information about actions in the console.
* '''Preferences...''' Allows setting other options, namely:
** Whether the position of dialogs should be remembered across restarts
** Whether [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip Gzip] compression (lossless) should be used to reduce the storage footprint of ".traces" files.
** "Reset Preferences..." Allows the reset of all options to their defaults. A restart of SNT may be required for changes to take effect.

== 3D Tab ==
[[File:SNT-3D-Tab.png|right|thumb|300px|"3D" menu tab]]
This tab aggregates widgets related to 3D interaction.
===Reconstruction Viewer===
The Reconstruction Viewer is an advanced OpenGL visualization tool. For performance reasons, some Path Manager changes may need to be synchronized manually from RV controls. To open Reconstruction Viewer with the currently loaded tracings, press ''Open Reconstruction Viewer''. For more information, see the Reconstruction Viewer wiki page.
===Legacy 3D Viewer===
The Legacy 3D Viewer is a functional tracing canvas but it depends on outdated services that are now deprecated. It may not function reliably on recent operating systems. For usage instructions, see [[SNT:_Step-By-Step_Instructions#Legacy_3D_Viewer|Legacy 3D Viewer]]
===SciView=== 
[[SciView|SciView]] is IJ2's modern replacement for the Legacy 3D Viewer providing 3D visualization and virtual reality capabilities for both images and meshes. It is not yet available in SNT.
{{clear}}


=Contextual Menu=
Right-clicking on any of the image views will bring up a menu with various editing tools. The corresponding keyboard shortcuts are shown to the right of each option.
[[Image:SNT-Path-Edit-Right-Click-Menu.png|right|thumb|250px|Contextual menu]]
* '''Select Nearest Path''' {{key|G}} or {{key|Shift}}+{{key|G}} Will select the path closest to the mouse cursor. 
* '''Fork at Nearest Node''' {{key|Shift}}+{{key|Alt}}+{{key|Left Click}} Creates a fork point at the node closest to the mouse cursor. Once a fork point is made, the branch may be extended as described in [[SNT:_Step-By-Step_Instructions#Branching:_Start_A_Path_On_An_Existing_Path|III. Extend The Path]].
* '''Continue Extending Path''' Allows continued tracing of previously finished paths. Note only one path may be extended at a time. To extend a path: first select it, choose this option, then place additional nodes as shown in [[SNT:_Step-By-Step_Instructions#II._Pick_A_Subsequent_Point| II. Pick A Subsequent Point]].
* '''Pause SNT''' Disables core functionality until this option is inactivated. "SNT Paused" [[SNT:_Overview#UI_Interaction|canvas annotations]] in the views indicate this state.
* '''Pause Tracing''' Disables tracing functions until this option is inactivated. "Tracing Paused" [[SNT:_Overview#UI_Interaction|canvas annotations]] in the views indicate this state.
* '''Sholl Analysis at Nearest Node''' {{key|Shift}}+{{key|Alt}}+{{Key|A}} Runs the [[Sholl_Analysis|Sholl Analysis]] plugin found in {{bc|Analyze|Sholl|Sholl Analysis (From Tracings)}}. Note the ''Center'' parameter, which sets the center point of the analysis, is left out as this value is given by the selected node.
===Editing Paths===
[[Image:SNT-Path-Edit-Right-Click-Menu-Active.png|right|thumb|250px]]
Pressing ''Edit Path'' with a single path selected will activate ''Edit Mode'', allowing use of the menu options under the ''Edit Path'' option. When ''Edit Mode'' is active, moving the mouse cursor along the path will activate the nearest node and synchronize the current Z-slice to the location of that node. Note that the ability to create new paths is temporarily disabled when in ''Edit Mode''.
* '''Reset Active Node''' Clears the active node from the cursor.
* '''Delete Active Node''' {{key|D}} or {{key|Backspace}} Permanently removes the active node from the path.
* '''Insert New Node At Cursor Position''' {{key|I}} Inserts a new node at the cursor position. The inserted node is placed between the active node and its parent.
* '''Move Active Node to Cursor Position''' {{key|M}} Moves the active node to the cursor position.
* '''Bring Active Node to Current Z-plane''' {{key|B}} Moves the active node to the active Z-plane. Note that the translation is only done in Z. XY positions are unchanged.
* '''Connect To (Start Join)''' Allows two existing paths to be [[SNT:_Step-By-Step_Instructions#Merging.2FJoining_Paths|merged or joined]].

=Path Manager=
[[File:SNT-Path-Manager.png|right|thumb|Path Manager]]
The Path Manager dialog displays all existing paths in a hierarchical structure (tree), where one path is "primary" (path 0) and all other paths (paths 1...N) are children of the primary path. The dialog also contains several menus with various editing, tagging, refinement/fitting, filling and analysis options. Paths can be searched by name and/or tags in the text filter, with more sophisticated search capabilities in the Advanced Filtering Menu. 

===Edit===
* '''Delete''' Removes selected path(s) from the Path Manager.
* '''Rename''' Renames the selected path.
* '''Make Primary''' Makes the selected path the primary path, moving it to the top of the tree. Note that this will alter the reconstruction topology.
* '''Disconnect'''  Disconnects the selected path from all of its connections (Undoable operation)
* '''Merge''' Merges the selected paths (at least two) into one. Note the starting node of path ''i'' is merged to the endpoint of path ''i+1''
* '''Specify Radius''' Assigns a constant radius to all the nodes of selected path(s). This setting only applies to unfitted paths and overrides any existing values. 
[[File:SNT-Path-Manager-Edit.png|right|thumb|200px|"Edit" menu]]
* '''Ramer-Douglas-Peuker Downsampling''' Given an inputted maximum permitted distance between adjacent nodes, performs [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer%E2%80%93Douglas%E2%80%93Peucker_algorithm Ramer-Douglas-Peucker] downsampling on the selected path(s).

===Tag===
[[File:SNT-Path-Manager-Tag.png|right|thumb|]]
Assigns tags to Paths. Tags are organized in the following categories:
* '''Type''' Type of neurite compartment (''Axon'', ''(Basal) Dendrite'', etc.), as used by the SWC format. It is also possible to pair each type with a color tag by enabling the respective option in {{bc|Tag|Options..}}<br>These tags are considered to be essential annotations and all paths are assigned the ''Undefined''-type tag when created. For this reason they are not eliminated by the ''Remove All Tags'' command.
* '''Color''' A preset swatch color, a custom one chosen from the color chooser.  Note that is also possible to assign mapping LUTs using the {{bc|Analyze|Color Coding}} command.
* '''Image Metadata''' Information on hyperstack position details  (e.g., channel or frame on which a path was traced).
* '''Morphology''' Morphometric properties, such as ''Path length'', ''Path mean radius'' or ''[[Strahler Analysis|branch order]]''.
* '''Custom''' Ad-hoc comments.
Note that only SWC-type tags are preserved across restarts when saving traces in the SWC format. All others require data to be saved in SNT's own .Traces format.
