Templates are pre-written scripts in a particular scripting language. They can be distributed as any other plugin, and automatically discovered by the [[Script Editor]]. Templates thus present an excellent way to demonstrate a particular operation to a wide audience of users.

Available templates are sorted by language under the <code>Templates</code> menu of the [[Script Editor]]. The contents of a template will be loaded into the editor window when selected. The script can then be inspected, executed and modified as normal.

The [[Script Editor]] will automatically search the <code>script-templates</code> directory and register any discovered scripts as templates. For example, a [[Maven|Mavenized]] project could add a sample script in <code>src/main/resources/script-templates</code> and it would be packaged into the appropriate location of the resultant <code>.jar</code>.

The templates need to be put into a subdirectory corresponding with the correct  script language name. So a <code>FFT.rb</code> script would need to be but into the `script-templates/Ruby/` directory to be available under the {{bc | Templates | Ruby}} menu. This is required so that templates are made available only when the corresponding script language is available. 

For examples of how the existing templates are structured and distributed, take a look at the [https://github.com/imagej/imagej-legacy/tree/master/src/main/resources/script-templates <code>imagej-legacy</code> project] (which maintains the script templates that were previously shipped with Fiji's script editor).

= Template best practices =

Above all else, templates should be '''well documented'''. Templates are intended to explain specific functionality in a given language, to users who may have limited experience with the language or programming/scripting in general.

Ideally, a template will be focused on an a single objective (e.g. opening an image, calculating a threshold, operating on a directory, etc...).

It is especially helpful to document how the template can be adapted to meet the user's needs.
