}}This plugin assesses the focus quality of microscope images, classifying the image in tiles.

== Summary ==

The plugin predicts an absolute measure of image focus on a single image in isolation, without any user-specified parameters. It uses a pre-trained deep neural network, operating at the image-patch level, and also outputs a measure of prediction certainty, enabling interpretable predictions.

== Installation ==

* [[Following an update site|Enable]] the TensorFlow [[update site]].
* The command is in {{bc | Classification | Microscope Image Focus Quality}}.

== Limitations ==

The plugin is currently limited to 16-bit integer data only. The model was trained with images in the intensity range of <code>[0, ~10000]</code>; your mileage may vary if the input image intensities diverge from that too greatly.
