This plugins adds time stamps to a stack. The times are drawn in the current foreground color. Use the color picker (''Image > Color > Color Picker'' or double-click on the color picker button [[Image:color_picker.png|16px]] ) to set the foreground color. A dialog box allows the user to specify the starting time, time between frames, location, font size, decimal places and unit of time. Create a rectangular selection and the X and Y locations in the dialog box will be based on that selection. Set time between frames to zero to display nothing but the text in the Suffix field.
