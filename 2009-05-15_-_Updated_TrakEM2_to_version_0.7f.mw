[[TrakEM2]] has been updated to version 0.7f

Please call "Help - Update Fiji" to get the new TrakEM2_.jar into your plugins folder.

The update includes:

*Fixes for AreaList mesh generation.
*Fixes for blending overlapping images: images where width and height were different were failing to blend.
*Fixes for creating new AreaList, new Pipe, etc: now correctly repainting the first area or point added.
*Now {{key|Ctrl}}+{{key|A}} ({{key|Command}}+{{key|A}} in macosx) selects all but sensitive to object visibility and the presence of a ROI.
*Now one must {{key|Shift}}+{{key|click}} the first point to get the Profile to close, or {{key|Shift}}+{{key|C}} any time to toggle the closed state.

Thanks to [http://www.ini.uzh.ch/people/german German Koestinger] and {{Person|Saalfeld}} for testing and bug reports.
