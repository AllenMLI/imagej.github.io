(Return to the main [[Simple Neurite Tracer]] page)

If you have the "three pane view" of Simple Neurite Tracer enabled, there is are a couple of key shortcuts that you should know about:

=== "Shift" in Three Pane View ===

If you hold down the {{key|Shift}} key while moving the mouse in any of the three panes, the view in the other panes will be synchronized.

=== Zooming in Three Pane View ===

Pressing {{key|+}} or {{key|-}} in any of the three panes will zoom in or out all three of the panes.

When zoomed in, you can pan around the image by holding down {{key|Space}} while clicking and dragging with the left mouse button in the image window.
