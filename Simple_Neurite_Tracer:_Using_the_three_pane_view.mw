If you have the "three pane view" of Simple Neurite Tracer enabled, there is one key shortcut that you must know about:

=== "Shift" in Three Pane View ===

If you hold down the "Shift" key while moving the mouse in any of the three panes, the view in the other panes will be synchronized.

=== Zooming in Three Pane View ===

Pressing '+' or '-' in any of the three panes will zoom in or out all three of the panes.

When zoomed in, you can pan around the image by holding down "Space" while clicking and dragging with the left mouse button in the image window.
