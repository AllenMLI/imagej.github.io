The community encourages discussion about proposed changes on the [[Mailing Lists|ImageJ and imagej-devel mailing lists]]. Submit your ideas!

Start on the mailing lists, searching for discussions related to your contribution to get some context & background. It can also be helpful to search for applicable issues and plans in ImageJ's [http://trac.imagej.net/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&status=reviewing&type=feature&group=milestone&report=1&order=priority Trac issue tracker] or on the GitHub issue list for [https://github.com/imagej/imagej/issues ImageJ2], [https://github.com/imglib/imglib2/issues ImgLib2], and [https://github.com/scifio/scifio/issues SCIFIO]. The ImageJ community believes that [[Philosophy#Open_source|public discussion is important]] so that ideas are not lost and exposed to healthy alternate points of view.

== ImageJ2 ==
Submit patches to [[ImageJ2]] via [https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/ pull requests] against [https://github.com/imagej ImageJ2's source on GitHub].

Note that since ImageJ2 has a modular [[architecture]], it is possible that your change would be more applicable to one of the supporting technologies such as [https://github.com/imglib ImgLib2], [https://github.com/scifio SCIFIO] or [https://github.com/scijava SciJava].

== ImageJ1 ==
Changes to [[ImageJ1]] are made by Wayne Rasband, who is the sole [[ImageJ1]] developer. He takes patch submissions and then reworks them to fit within the project's development model and style before merging them. Attribution for the changes is noted in the release notes (see [http://imagej.net/notes.html ImageJ1's Release Notes/News]). 

Methods of getting the patch to Wayne include:
* Send the modified code in a private mail to Wayne (he does not like to discuss code on the mailing list)
* Send a patch to Wayne via private mail (it should apply to [https://github.com/imagej/imagej1/commit/master the latest revision] and must not use any Git extension because Wayne uses <code>patch(1)</code> to apply the patch)
* Send a patch to the [mailto:imagej-devel@imagej.net imagej-devel mailing list] (but note that traditionally, Wayne does not discuss code there)
* Submit a pull request on GitHub against {{GitHub|org=imagej|repo=imagej1|label=Wayne's ImageJ1 repository}} (please note, though, that none of [https://github.com/imagej/imagej1/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed the past Pull Requests] were merged using the standard Git workflow)

The important part is that Wayne receive the code/patch, since he is the only one with the authority to merge it.
