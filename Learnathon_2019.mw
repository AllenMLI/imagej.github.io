''"I currently work as a contract Image Processing R&D Engineer. I have helped groups develop and commercialize deconvolution and single particle localization algorithms for novel instruments. I have strong ties to the open source community, and have made several contributions to ImageJ, specifically imagej-ops and imagej-tutorials. I've worked with groups such as the Open Science Foundation to develop reproducible workflows using KNIME. I'm also an adjunct instructor at the Department of Informatics, University at Albany, teaching Data Analysis using Python and KNIME."''

'''Florian Levet'''
''"After working as an engineer in the Bordeaux Imaging Center, I am currently a researcher in the Sibarita lab at the Interdisciplinary Institute for Neuroscience in Bordeaux. I wrote several ImageJ plugins for segmenting or quantifying the apposition or the morphology of different kind of biological models. I also developed from scratch two platforms called SR-Tesseler and Coloc-Tesseler for quantifying single-molecule localization microscopy data."''

''''I am a postdoc in the Saalfeld lab at Janelia, working on anatomical templates, and large scale, multimodal image registration.  I am the author of the Bigwarp Fiji plugin, and contribute to imglib2 and bigdataviewer. There is lots of room in my heart for both the "new hotness" of deep learning and "old school" computer vision techniques."''

''''I am currently a grad student in the Saalfeld lab at Janelia. I work on neuron reconstruction from electron microscopy data with machine learning and develop proof-reading and data annotation tools. I am an ImgLib2 and recent Kotlin enthusiast and enjoy writing efficient image processing and analysis software"''
