'''Brian Northan'''
''"I currently work as a contract Image Processing R&D Engineer. I have helped groups develop and commercialize deconvolution and single particle localization algorithms for novel instruments. I have strong ties to the open source community, and have made several contributions to ImageJ, specifically imagej-ops and imagej-tutorials. I've worked with groups such as the Open Science Foundation to develop reproducible workflows using KNIME. I'm also an adjunct instructor at the Department of Informatics, University at Albany, teaching Data Analysis using Python and KNIME."''
