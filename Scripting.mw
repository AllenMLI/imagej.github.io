{{Scripting}}{{TOC}}
ImageJ allows you to write scripts in several different languages.

= Getting started =

* Press the {{key|[}} key to open the [[Script Editor]] (or {{key|Shift}}-{{key|[}} to open the [[Script Interpreter]]).
* Optionally, choose a template from the ''Templates'' menu to get you started.
* Otherwise, choose your language from the ''Language'' menu.
* Grab code snippets for common tasks from the [[Scripting toolbox]].
* See [[Scripting comparisons]] for a side-by-side comparison of scripting languages.
* See [[:Category:Scripting]] for a list of all scripting-related pages on this wiki.

= Supported languages =

ImageJ's [[Script Editor]] supports the following languages:

* [[Beanshell Scripting|BeanShell]]
* [[Groovy Scripting|Groovy]]
* [[Introduction into Macro Programming|ImageJ Macro]]
* [[Introduction into Developing Plugins|Java]]
* [[Javascript Scripting|JavaScript]]
* [[Clojure Scripting|Lisp (Clojure)]]
* [[Jython Scripting|Python (Jython)]]
* [[Renjin Scripting|R (Renjin)]]
* [[JRuby Scripting|Ruby (JRuby)]]
* [[Scala Scripting|Scala]]

Additionally, these languages can be installed via [http://fiji.sc/Update_Sites update sites]:
* [[MATLAB Scripting|MATLAB]]

= Script parameters =

There is a universal <code>@parameter</code> notation available across all scripts for declaring inputs and outputs. This approach is preferred to using ImageJ 1.x <code>GenericDialog</code> because it is totally agnostic to the user interface, allowing such scripts to run in a variety of contexts.

See the [[script parameters]] page for details.

= Using an interpreter =

All scripting languages use the same basic interpreter, with the following common features.

== General key bindings ==

* up arrow: bring the previously typed command.
* down arrow: bring the next typed command.
* enter or return: execute the contents of the prompt.

== Multiline editing and keybindings==

You can enlarge the prompt by dragging the middle bar.

* {{key|Shift||Enter}}: create a new line within the prompt.
* {{key|Shift||Up}}: move to the line above within the prompt.
* {{key|Shift|Down}}: move to the line below within the prompt.

== Selecting and executing text from the screen ==

On selecting text, a popup offers to:

* copy
* execute
* save to a new file

= Using the script editor =

You can create, edit and run scripts using Fiji's script editor.  For details, please see [[Using the Script Editor|the Script Editor documentation]].

= Adding scripts to the Plugins menu =

For the script to appear in the Plugin menus, the following must apply:

# The script file is saved in the <code>ImageJ.app/plugins</code> directory (or a subdirectory thereof).
# The script name ends in a supported script extension. For example, ".js" for javascript, ".py" for jython, ".rb" for jruby, ".clj" for clojure, and ".bs" for beanshell script. 'NOTE:' ".txt" is not a supported script language.
# The script name contains a '_' (underscore) character, e.g. "MyScript_.ijm"

The extension will be stripped and any underscores will be turned into spaces before the script is added to the menus.

Scripts in the top-level "plugins" directory will appear at the bottom of the Plugins menu. Scripts can be placed in other menus by by nesting subdirectories, for example placing a script in the "/plugins/Scripts/File" directory will add it to the File menu.

If you aren't able to find your script, you can always run the [[Using_the_Command_Launcher|Command Finder]] to verify its location (or absence).

= Running scripts in headless mode =

See the [[Headless#Running_scripts_in_headless_mode|Headless]] page for instructions on executing scripts headlessly.
