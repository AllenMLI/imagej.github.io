==TrakEM2 Display==

A TrakEM2 display is simply an interactive canvas for viewing and editing the contents of a layer: drag images, register them, add new images by drag and drop, put floating text labels, etc.

Within a display any number of layers may be browsed –just like slices in a stack.

TrakEM2 Display showing 9 images in a layer, where 2 images and one floating text
label (set to 30% transparency) are selected (pink and white frames; white is the active one – note the corresponding pink and blue coloration of the object panels on the left). The Navigator (bottom left) paints a red frame to indicate the area currently displayed in the canvas (right).
