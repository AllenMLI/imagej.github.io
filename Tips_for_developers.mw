An unsorted list of hints that you might find useful:

=== compile & execute a class ===

You do not need to call ''javac'' yourself with a long classpath:

$ ./fiji --javac YourClass.java

and you can call its main() method just as easy:

$ ./fiji YourClass.class argument1 argument2

=== rapidly prototype a plugin ===

It is often easier to start out with a Jython, JRuby or BeanShell script, as you do not have to care about strict typing, exceptions or recompiling.  Just place your script (with the correct extension -- .py, .rb or .bsh) into the plugins/ folder and execute the script.  Fiji will always execute the current version of the script, so you can edit and run the script without restarting Fiji.

Of course, it is even more convenient to use the [[Script Editor]]...

Once you have working code, you can turn it into a proper plugin (this is easiest with BeanShell, as its syntax is closest to Java already), adding strict typing and exception handling as needed.

=== find the .jar file containing a certain class ===

Sometimes, the compiler complains about a class not having a certain method or interface, but you ''know'' it must contain it.  More often than not, that class exists in different versions in your classpath.  Find out with

$ ./fiji bin/find-jar-for-class.py the.class.youre.looking.For

= Using ImageJ effectively =

ImageJ has a simple API, but it is also big, so here are a few pointers to some useful parts.

== How to read a file into an ImagePlus ==

<source lang="java">
 ImagePlus image = IJ.openImage(path);
</source>

== How to display an exception in a window ==

This is especially useful on Windows, where you usually do not see the console:

<source lang="java">
 IJ.handleException(exception);
</source>

This is available since ImageJ 1.43g, as well as the option to set a different exception handler using

<source lang="java">
 IJ.setExceptionHandler(new IJ.ExceptionHandler() {
    public void handle(Throwable exception) {
       // do something
    }
 });
</source>

== How to show a plot ==

ImageJ offers the ''ij.gui.Plot'' class to make a window showing a plot. Use it like this:

<source lang="java">
 Plot plot = new Plot("The window title", "labels on the x-axis", "labels on the y-axis",
    float_array_of_x_values, float_array_of_y_values);
 plot.show();
</source>

Instead of ''float'' arrays, you can also use ''double'' arrays.
