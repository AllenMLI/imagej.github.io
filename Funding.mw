{{About}}__NOTOC__== ImageJ 1.x ==

Historically, [[ImageJ 1.x]] was funded internally by the [http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ Research Services] branch of the [http://nih.gov/ National Institutes of Health]. It is developed by {{Person|Rasband}}, who is now retired, and continues his work on ImageJ1 as an NIH special volunteer.

== ImageJ2 ==

[[ImageJ2]] was initially funded from 2010 through 2012 by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 NIH Research and Research Infrastructure "Grand Opportunities" Grant, '''"Hardening" of Biomedical Informatics/Computing Software for Robustness and Dissemination''' (Ref: RC2 GM092519-01). For more information on the grant call, see the listing on the NIGMS [http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Research/pages/GrandOpportunityAreas.aspx Grand Opportunity Areas] page. See also the original [[ImageJ2 grant proposal]] from 2009.

In recent years, ImageJ2 development has been funded by several sources, including a [http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/ Wellcome Trust] Strategic Award (Ref: 095931) for the [[OMERO]] project, and substantial development effort at the University of Konstanz and elsewhere. The ImageJ2 project as a whole is maintained by {{Person|Rueden}} and {{Person|Hinerm}} of UW-Madison [[LOCI]].

== SCIFIO ==

[[SCIFIO]] is funded by the [http://nsf.gov/ National Science Foundation], award number [http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1148362 1148362]. It is developed by {{Person|Hinerm}} and {{Person|Rueden}} of UW-Madison [[LOCI]].

== ImgLib2 ==

The [[ImgLib2]] project was developed by {{Person|Saalfeld}}, {{Person|StephanP}} and {{Person|Pietzsch}} of the [http://mpi-cbg.de/research/research-groups/pavel-tomancak.html Tomancak lab] at [http://mpi-cbg.de/ MPI-CBG]. In recent years, [[ImgLib2]] is funded indirectly by the various involved software efforts, including the Tomancak and Saalfeld labs as well as the [[ImageJ2]] project. The ImgLib2 project as a whole is organized and maintained by {{Person|Pietzsch}} of MPI-CBG, {{Person|Saalfeld}} of Janelia Research Campus, and {{Person|Rueden}} of UW-Madison [[LOCI]].

== SciJava ==

Core [[SciJava]] libraries are funded indirectly by the various involved software efforts, including [[ImageJ2]], [[KNIME]], [[OMERO]] and [[CellProfiler]]. The SciJava project as a whole is organized and maintained by {{Person|Rueden}} and {{Person|Hinerm}} of UW-Madison [[LOCI]].

== Fiji ==

The [[Fiji]] distribution of [[ImageJ]] for the life sciences is a broad collection of plugins by many authors across the worldwide community.

Fiji development is funded indirectly by various institutions as part of their respective research and development goals. Fiji as a whole is organized and maintained as part of the ImageJ2 effort by {{Person|Rueden}} and {{Person|Hinerm}} of UW-Madison [[LOCI]].
