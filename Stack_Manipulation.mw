This package regroup various "small" plugins dedicated to the manipulation of stacks, allowing to sort them, combine them, etc...
As they are more of a utility package, they all can be found in the ''Image > Stacks'' menu.


What they do is pretty much summarized by the following diagram, taken from the MacBiophotonics<ref>http://www.macbiophotonics.ca/imagej/stack.htm</ref> webpage.
