== Content and purpose ==

This package regroup various "small" plugins dedicated to the manipulation of stacks, allowing to sort them, combine them, etc...
As they are more of a utility package, they all can be found in the ''Image > Stacks > Manipulation'' menu.


What they do is pretty much summarized by the following diagram, taken from the MacBiophotonics<ref>http://www.macbiophotonics.ca/imagej/stack.htm</ref> webpage.

* The '''Grouped ZProjector''' acts a bit like the '''Substack Maker''', for it allows to reduce the number of frame within a stack. But rather than taking a slice every certain step, it combines a group of slices and project them on a single slice. The size of the groups is configurable, and must be a divisor of the total number of slice. 






== Documentation ==



=== Grouped ZProjector ===

From the source code:

Grouped_ZProjector performs a z-projection on a stack of images.
The stack is segregated into some number of groups (by specifying
a group size) and a z-projection is performed on each group using
ZProjector.  The result is a new stack of images, one slice for
each group. The output stack has the same type as the input stack.
The projection methods supported are the same as for ZProjector;
currently "Average Intensity", "Max Intensity", and "Sum Slices".
(It appears that ZProjector actually uses the "Average Intensity"
method instead of the "Sum Slices" method.)

Grouped_ZProjector is primarily designed to be run as a plugin
from within the ImageJ environment, but may also be used by other
plugins, etc...  When launched as a plugin, the default constructor
is used and then the run method is called.  Other code wishing to
use Grouped_ZProjector should use the <tt>setMethod</tt> and <tt>computeProjection</tt>
methods directly; the <tt>buildDialog</tt> <tt>getMethod</tt>, and <tt>validGroupSize</tt> methods
may also come in handy.
