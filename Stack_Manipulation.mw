== Content and purpose ==

This package regroup various "small" plugins dedicated to the manipulation of stacks, allowing to sort them, combine them, etc...
As they are more of a utility package, they all can be found in the ''Image > Stacks > Manipulation'' menu.


What they do is pretty much summarized by the following diagram, taken from the MacBiophotonics<ref>http://www.macbiophotonics.ca/imagej/stack.htm</ref> webpage.

* The '''Grouped ZProjector''' acts a bit like the '''Substack Maker''', for it allows to reduce the number of frame within a stack. But rather than taking a slice every certain step, it combines a group of slices and project them on a single slice. The size of the groups is configurable, and must be a divisor of the total number of slice. 



== Author and licenses ==

We list here the authors for each part of this package, with corresponding licenses when relevant.
