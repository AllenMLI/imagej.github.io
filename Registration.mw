== What is Registration? ==

[[wikipedia:Image registration|Image registration]] is the process of transforming different sets of data into one coordinate system. Data may be multiple photographs, data from different sensors, times, depths, or viewpoints. It is used in computer vision, medical imaging, biological imaging and brain mapping, military automatic target recognition, and compiling and analyzing images and data from satellites. Registration is necessary in order to be able to compare or integrate the data obtained from these different measurements.

== Recommended ImageJ Plugins for Registration ==

Here we summarize some of the Registration plugins in ImageJ.

|'''Plugin Name'''

|'''Plugin Snapshot'''
|-
|[http://imagej.net/Feature_Extraction Feature Extraction]
|A tool for identifying a set of corresponding points of interest in two images
|
* Interest points are detected using the Difference of Gaussian detector
* Uses the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)] and [http://matthewalunbrown.com/papers/cvpr05.pdf Multi-Scale Oriented Patches (MOPS)] for local feature description
* Established matches are filtered using the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_sample_consensus Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC)]
* The extracted sets of corresponding landmarks and the calculated transformations are used in [https://imagej.net/TrakEM2 TrakEM2], [https://imagej.net/Register_Virtual_Stack_Slices Register Virtual Stack Slices] and [https://imagej.net/BUnwarpJ BUnwarpJ] for image registration.

|-
|[https://imagej.net/Linear_Stack_Alignment_with_SIFT Linear Stack Alignment with SIFT]
|A tool for aligning image stacks
|
* A lightweight SIFT-implementation for Java after the paper of David Lowe<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lowe D | title=Distinctive Image Features from Scale-Invariant Keypoints | journal=International Journal of Computer Vision | year=2004 | volume=60 | number=2 | pages=91-110}}</ref>.
|
|-
|[https://imagej.net/BUnwarpJ BUnwarpJ]
|A tool for elastic and consistent image registration
|
* Performs 2D image registration based on elastic deformations represented by B-splines
* Invertibility of the deformations is enforced through a consistency restriction
* Get started with the detailed [https://imagej.net/BUnwarpJ#User_Manual BUnwarpJ user manual]

|-
|[https://imagej.net/TrakEM2 TrakEM2]
|A tool for morphological data mining, three-dimensional modeling and image stitching, '''registration''', editing and annotation.
|
* Registers floating image tiles to each other using SIFT and global optimization algorithms.
* See the [https://www.ini.uzh.ch/~acardona/trakem2_manual.html#registration TrakEM2 sser manual section on registration]
