{{TOC}}ImageJ has a lot of keyboard shortcuts.

== Listing all keyboard shortcuts ==

For a verbose list of keyboard shortcuts, call {{bc | Plugins | Shortcuts | List Shortcuts}}.

== The Command Launcher ==

Use {{key|Ctrl}}+{{key|L}} (on Mac, {{key|Command}}+{{key|L}}) to open the [[Using the Command Launcher|Command Launcher]], to call menu entries by name.

== Recent Commands ==

To open a list of some recent commands, and a list of the most frequently called commands, hit {{key|Ctrl}}+{{key|9}} (on Mac, {{key|Command}}+{{key|9}}).

== Open ==

To open new images, type {{key|Ctrl}}+{{key|O}} (on Mac, {{key|Command}}+{{key|O}}).

== Creating your own keyboard shortcuts ==

You can also [https://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-31.html#toc-Subsection-31.2 assign your own keyboard shortcuts]!

== Assign a shortcut to a macro ==
There are 3 options to assign a keyboard shortcut to a macro.<br>

=== Option 1: Edit the StartupMacros file ===
Either put the code of the macro in the file macro>StartupMacros.ijm (or StartupMacros.fiji.ijm in Fiji) to have it installed automatically at startup.<br>
The code of the macro must declare a keyboard shortcut in square bracket as such
<source>
macro "Macro 1 [1]" {
    print("The user pressed '1' on the top row of the keyboard");
    } 

macro "Macro 1 [n1]" {
    print("The user pressed '1' on the numerical keypad");
    } 

macro "Macro 2 [h]" {
   print ("the user pressed 'h'");
   }

macro "Macro 3 [H]"{
  print ("the user pressed 'shift + h'");
  } 
</source>

The key defined in square bracket is case sensitive ! If a capital letter is used then the shortcut is "shift + key".

=== Option 2: Save the macro(s) as a toolset ===
The shortcut should be defined in square bracket like for option 1, but instead of editing the existing StartupMacros file, the macros(s) can be saved as a separate MyShortcut.ijm or .txt file in the ImageJ/Fiji subfolder <code>macros/toolsets</code>.<br>
Then restart ImageJ/Fiji and click the {{bc|>>}} at the rightmost side of the fiji toolbar and click the entry MyShortcut. This will install your macros and thus activate the associated shortcuts.<br>
This option is more convenient to distribute macros with keyboard shortcuts to colleagues or via an update site.

=== Option 3: Associate shortcut to a plugin menu entry ===
The second possibility consist in saving the macro code as a small script file into the <code>./Fiji.app/scripts/Plugins/</code> folder, so that it appears in the menu upon restart.<br> 
Then you can register a shortcut using {{bc|Plugins|Shortcuts|Add Shortcutâ€¦}}
