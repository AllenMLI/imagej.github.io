You can also [http://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-31.html#toc-Subsection-31.2 assign your own keyboard shortcuts]!

== Assign a shortcut to a macro ==
There are 2 options to assign a keyboard shortcut to a macro.<br>

=== Option 1: StartupMacros ===
Either put the code of the macro in the file macro>StartupMacros.ijm (or StartupMacros.fiji.ijm in Fiji) to have it installed automatically.<br>
The code of the macro must declared a keyboard shortcut in square bracket as such
<source>
macro "Macro 1 [1]" {
    print("The user pressed '1'");
    } 
</source>

=== Option 2: Associate shortcut to a plugin menu entry ===
The second possibility consist in saving the macro code as a small script file into the ./Fiji.app/scripts/Plugins/ folder, so that it appears in the menu upon restart.<br> 
Then you can register a shortcut using Plugins > Shortcuts > Add Shortcutâ€¦
