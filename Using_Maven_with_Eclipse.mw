To take full advantage of a Maven-based project from within Eclipse, you should install the Maven plugin according to these steps. Please note that you must be using Eclipse 3.5 or newer.

== Install m2eclipse ==

From the Eclipse menu, choose Help > Install New Software...

Click the Add button to add an update site:
* Name: m2eclipse
* Location: http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/sites/m2e
* Click OK

Check the item that appears—Maven Integration for Eclipse—and click Next.

Click Next again, accept the license terms, and click Finish.

Restart Eclipse.


== Configure Eclipse (Windows only) ==

On Windows, you will need to launch Eclipse with the "-vm" flag pointing to an installation of the Java Development Kit (JDK).

First, download and install JDK 6 from the Java web site.

Take note of where the Java installation ended up; we will use "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_20" below, though your path is likely to be different.

Also take note of the path to your Eclipse installation; we will use "C:\Users\you\Programs\eclipse" though your path is likely to be different. 

Next, create a shortcut to eclipse.exe that points to your installed JDK:
* Right-click the Desktop, New, Shortcut
* In the box, specify: "C:\Users\you\Programs\eclipse\eclipse.exe" -vm "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_20\bin"
* Click Next, name the shortcut "Eclipse" and click Finish
* Use this shortcut whenever you launch Eclipse; add to the Start menu or taskbar if you wish

Now update Eclipse's JRE to be JDK-aware:
* Launch Eclipse
* From the menu choose Window > Preferences
* Select Java > Installed JREs
* Click Search..., navigate to "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_20" and click OK
* Check the box next to the JDK that appears and click OK
