To take full advantage of a Maven-based project from within Eclipse, you should install the Maven plugin according to these steps. Please note that you must be using Eclipse 3.5 or newer.

For more information about Maven, see:

== Install m2eclipse ==

From the Eclipse menu, choose Help > Install New Software...

Click the Add button to add an update site:
* Name: m2eclipse
* Location: http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/sites/m2e
* Click OK

Check the item that appears—Maven Integration for Eclipse—and click Next.

Click Next again, accept the license terms, and click Finish.

Restart Eclipse.


== Configure Eclipse (Windows only) ==

On Windows, you will need to configure Eclipse to use the Java Development Kit (JDK).

First, download and install JDK 6 from the Java web site.

Take note of where the Java installation ended up; we will use "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_20" below, though your path is likely to be different.

Also take note of the path to your Eclipse installation; we will use "C:\Users\you\Programs\eclipse" though your path is likely to be different. 

Open the file "C:\Users\you\Programs\eclipse\eclipse.ini" in a text editor, and follow [http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse.ini#Specifying_the_JVM these instructions] to specify the JVM using the "-vm" flag. Be careful to follow the instructions exactly.

Now update Eclipse's JRE to be JDK-aware:
* Launch Eclipse
* From the menu choose Window > Preferences
* Select Java > Installed JREs
* Click Search..., navigate to "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_20" and click OK
* Check the box next to the JDK that appears and click OK
