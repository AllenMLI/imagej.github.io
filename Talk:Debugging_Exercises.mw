==Exercise 8: Profiling==

Used when we need information about performance

exercise: two methods, which takes more time to run?

* open jvisualvm
* run E8 program
* double-click in jvisualvm
* open “profile” tab
* click “Settings”
* change package to net.imagej.trouble.**
* start profiling.


question box: which method took longer?


==Exercise 9: Multiple threads==

Even though no code changes, sometimes debugging affects code execution

exercise: debug once where breakpoint stops thread, once where it stops vm

* Run E9 with no breakpoint. Note that it works fine
* Now set a breakpoint in the “getName” method of either the Even or Odd LonelyRunnable
* Set the breakpoints property to “Suspend thread”
* Debug E9. After hitting the breakpoint, wait for a few seconds. Eventually you should see that a different thread is paused and “Expecting Exception”.
* resume the threads and see the stack trace.
* Now modify the breakpoint and tell it to suspend VM instead of just the thread
* Debug again. When you hit a breakpoint, make sure you resume the VM and not just the thread.

== Exercise 2 - Ellen's Questions ==

Sorry guys... can you just clarify the final part of this exercise?  I get the point of expressions - just not necessarily how to implement them correctly and then go through the debugging process...  I'm missing something here...

"To complete this exercise:
1. Write an expression that calls the size() method of our list.
2. Write a 2nd expression that evaluates to the value of the index variable"

For these two steps...  wording is weird and confusing - so I'm not sure exactly what I need to do... (note: this could just be an Ellen-exclusive issue)

maybe another image - snapshot - would be helpful here??  something a bit more concrete - since this is really the point of this exercise - expressions...

== Exercise 3 - Ellen's Questions ==

Sorry - again... maybe because it is 'me'...  

Can you give me a concrete conditional statement as an example in the conditional breakpoints example step 5???

As a first-first-first timer... I have no idea what to even write!  Sorry.  I know... stupid, but true.

== Exercise 4 - Ellen's Questions ==

That's right!  I've made it to #4... but not without some more 'simple' questions...

I have NO idea what to do with :

ImageJ.app/ImageJ-linux64 --debugger=8000

huh?!

That's right.  In this case... even the link did not help me.

Sorry!
