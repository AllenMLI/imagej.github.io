==Exercise 8: Profiling==

Used when we need information about performance

exercise: two methods, which takes more time to run?

* open jvisualvm
* run E8 program
* double-click in jvisualvm
* open “profile” tab
* click “Settings”
* change package to net.imagej.trouble.**
* start profiling.


question box: which method took longer?


==Exercise 9: Multiple threads==

Even though no code changes, sometimes debugging affects code execution

exercise: debug once where breakpoint stops thread, once where it stops vm

* Run E9 with no breakpoint. Note that it works fine
* Now set a breakpoint in the “getName” method of either the Even or Odd LonelyRunnable
* Set the breakpoints property to “Suspend thread”
* Debug E9. After hitting the breakpoint, wait for a few seconds. Eventually you should see that a different thread is paused and “Expecting Exception”.
* resume the threads and see the stack trace.
* Now modify the breakpoint and tell it to suspend VM instead of just the thread
* Debug again. When you hit a breakpoint, make sure you resume the VM and not just the thread.

== Exercise 2 - Ellen's Questions ==

Sorry guys... can you just clarify the final part of this exercise?

"To complete this exercise:
1. Write an expression that calls the size() method of our list.
2. Write a 2nd expression that evaluates to the value of the index variable"

especially the last step...  english is weird and confusing to me exactly what i need to do...

(maybe another image - snapshot - would be helpful here??)
