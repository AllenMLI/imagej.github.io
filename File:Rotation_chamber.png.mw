Multi-view imaging with spinning disc confocal microscopy

(a) Sample chamber for multi-view imaging of specimens embedded in agarose column on an upright
microscope. (b) 3d reconstruction of cellular blastoderm stage Drosophila embryo imaged with 11
views on a spinning disc confocal set-up with 20x/0.5 water dipping lens. All views were deconvolved
using the Huygens software. (c) Cut-out from (b) showing equal cellular resolution around the entire
circumference of the embryo. (d) Superposition of maximum projection from two views (225° green and
270° magenta) highlighting their limited overlap (grey) and complementarities in specimen coverage.
Inset shows overlapping point spread functions of the beads.
