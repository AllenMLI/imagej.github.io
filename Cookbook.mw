== Introduction ==

This book intends to be a users' guide for Fiji.  No prior knowledge of ImageJ, programming, or "computer lingo" should be necessary to understand the recipes.

== Recipes ==

Cooks call them ''recipes'', biologists ''protocols'', and programmers call them ''HOWTOs''.  No matter how you refer to them, here they are:

=== How to get the appropriate version of Fiji running ===

=== How to open/import raw data ===

 Remark: programmers are often confused what you mean by ''raw data'' -- you talk about ''unprocessed'' data, while they refer to a certain file format.

Images come in many formats: LSM, Metamorph, Spot, CellR..... etc.  Most of them can be opened by Fiji (thanks to the [[Bio-Formats]] plugin.

The easiest method is to mark the files you want to open the folder (in Finder, Explorer, Konqueror or whatever the program is called on your operating system), and drag-n-drop them onto the Fiji main window.

=== How to navigate through 3D or 4D data ===

(turning, playing/making movies, projections)

=== How to measure angles (in 2D or 3D), distances, areas, intensities ===

=== How to analyze colocalization of labels ===

=== How to stitch together two images ===

=== How to view your data using volume rendering ===

=== How to segment objects, track them, deconvolution, filtering ===

all of which 2D, 3D and 4D

=== How to export measurements for use in other programs, such as R, Matlab or Excel ===

=== How to plot graphs from the measurements directly ===

=== How to control a microscope ===

(x-y-z drive, stacks, timeseries, autofocus, find object although they have moved and keep them in the field of view between timepoints; ,maybe even get a warning in the 4th floor, when something fails at the scope in the cellar)

=== How to make simple macros/scripting (like do a given operation of whole bunch of pictures....) ===

== Judith's questions ==

=== What is the secret meaning of life ===
