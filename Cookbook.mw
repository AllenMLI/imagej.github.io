__FORCETOC__ {{Cookbook}}

== Introduction ==

This book is an analysis-oriented introduction and user guide to Fiji. It is inspired by the defunct [[MBF Plugin Collection|MBF "ImageJ for microscopy" manual]] which went offline in November 2012, and it describes many of the same plugins from that distribution.

Cooks call them ''recipes'', biologists ''protocols'', and programmers call them ''HOWTOs''.  No matter how you refer to them, you'll find the book topics in the sidebar to the right!

Like the rest of the Fiji wiki, this Cookbook is a community project. Please feel welcome to edit and expand the material here!

== Installing Fiji ==

{{:Installation}}

== Installing the Cookbook plugins ==

This Cookbook makes use of several plugins beyond those available in Fiji out of the box. You can easily install them as follows:
* Help > Update Fiji
* Manage update sites
* Tick the "Cookbook" update site
* Close
* Apply changes
* Restart Fiji

== Source ==

The source code for the Cookbook plugins is coming soon to a [https://github.com/fiji/cookbook GitHub near you]!

If you need the source for these plugins RIGHT NOW, you can find it bundled inside the old [http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/mbf/ MBF ImageJ plugins] distribution. But we'll have them organized more cleanly in the GitHub repository very soon!

== Credits ==

The Cookbook plugins were collated from various sources and have various authors and licenses.
