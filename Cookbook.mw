__FORCETOC__ {{Cookbook}}

== Introduction ==

This book is an analysis-oriented introduction and user guide to Fiji. It is inspired by the defunct [[MBF Plugin Collection|MBF "ImageJ for microscopy" manual]] which went offline in November 2012, and it describes many of the same plugins from that distribution.

Cooks call them ''recipes'', biologists ''protocols'', and programmers call them ''HOWTOs''.  No matter how you refer to them, you'll find the book topics in the sidebar to the right!

Like the rest of the Fiji wiki, this Cookbook is a community project. Please feel welcome to edit and expand the material here!
