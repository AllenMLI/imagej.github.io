Thanks to the generous people at the [http://bigwww.epfl.ch/ Biomedical Imaging Group of the EPFL], we are now allowed to ship the [[Extended Depth of Field]] plugin with sources!

The plugin is useful if you recorded a sample at different focal depths and you want to have a single two-dimensional image showing as much in-focus information as possible.

Merry Christmas!
