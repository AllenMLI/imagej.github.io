[http://jruby.codehaus.org/ JRuby] is a marvellous project that has a complete implementation of Ruby in the JVM.  The excellent work of the authors of JRuby has made it very simple for us to add JRuby scripting into ImageJ.

JRuby scripting in ImageJ is an excellent alternative to scripting using ImageJ's macro language.  It has the following advantages:

* You don't have to learn a new language to script ImageJ (assuming you know Ruby)
* You're not limited to using the functionality exposed by the macro language: you can use any class in ImageJ, one of its plugins or standard Java
* Developing JRuby scripts is very fast compared to developing plugins in Java

(These advantages, of course, are shared by the [[Jython Scripting]], [[Clojure Scripting]], Beanscript and [[Javascript Scripting]] bundled in Fiji.)

== Tutorial ==

Let's start writing some JRuby right away - start up the interpreter by going to Plugins > Scripting > JRuby Interpreter.  The interpreter window will pop up, but it may take a little time for the JRuby runtime to be ready.

FIXME: complete this


[You may want to first have a quick look at the [[Scripting Help]] page for generic instructions in using the interpreter and script interfaces, and the [[Scripting comparisons]] page for an example written in several of the different scripting languages available.]
