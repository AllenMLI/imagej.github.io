This plugin allows to apply a '''similarity transformation''' (rotation, translation and isotropic scaling) to a 2D image in an interactive way.

'''Premises''': You need an image to be open.

'''Use''': 
# When calling the plugin, two points (represented as yellow PointRois) will be displayed on the image. 
# Drag and drop the points to interactively transform the image with a '''similarity model''' (rotation, translation and isotropic scaling).
# If you are satisfied with the result, press ENTER, otherwise, press ESC.
