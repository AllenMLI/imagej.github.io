{{FormatsMenu}}Thanks to ImageJ's [[extensibility]] via [[plugins]], it supports a lot of image formats!

== Life sciences ==

The [[Bio-Formats|OME Bio-Formats]] plugin provides support for over 130 file formats in microscopy, medical imaging, and related life science formats. Bio-Formats is included with the [[Fiji]] distribution of ImageJ. See also the Bio-Formats [https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/bio-formats/supported-formats.html list of supported formats].


== DICOM ==

ImageJ has some built-in support for the DICOM format, and there are also plugins for working with DICOM files. See the [[DICOM]] page for full details.

== HDF ==

The HDF5 [[update site]] enables suprport for reading and writing [[wikipedia:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format|HDF5]] image data. Note that HDF5 is a very broad specification; the HDF5 plugin will not support all manner of HDF files, but only those written according to its constraints.

== Video ==

Out of the box, ImageJ has limited support for some video formats such as AVI and [[QuickTime]], and there are also plugins which extend ImageJ's support for videos. See the [[Video]] page for details.
