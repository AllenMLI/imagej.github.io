== What is the VisBio Plugin? ==
The VisBio Ortho Stack plugin is a simple 3D visualization plugin for Fiji that displays a stack of image planes in a parallel or perspective projection along the z plane. The plugin can control several common operations, such as specifying distance between cross sections, rotating and zooming the RD view, and saving a snapshot of the current image to a file. 

== Updating the VisBio Plugin ==
The VisBio Plugin is located within the LOCI updates. To learn more on how to update plugins, visit the update fiji page.
