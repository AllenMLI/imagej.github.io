This page should list the requirements of Fiji on different platforms to solve installation problems easier.

==General==

==Windows==

* Java 3D 1.5.1 is shipped with Fiji and requires '''OpenGL 1.3 or higher'''. You can use ''Plugins > Utilities > Debugging > Test Java3D'' to test the functionality of Java 3D. If you do not see a rotating cube, install the latest graphics card driver for your system and check its OpenGL version. 

==Mac OS X==
