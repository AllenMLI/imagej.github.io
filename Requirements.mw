This page should list the requirements of Fiji on different platforms to solve installation problems easier.

==General==

==Windows==

* Java 3D 1.5.1 is shipped with Fiji and requires '''OpenGL 1.3 or higher'''. You can use ''Plugins {{arrow}} Utilities {{arrow}} Debugging {{arrow}} Test Java3D'' to test the functionality of Java 3D. If you do not see a rotating cube, install the latest graphics card driver for your system and check its OpenGL version. 

==Mac OS X==

* '''Mac OS X 10.4 or higher''' is required.  This is due to many plugins needing Java version 1.5 or higher, and Apple does not provide those versions with older Mac OS X versions.

''Note:'' This requirement might be lifted in the near future, as OpenJDK will merge the BSD port soon, which includes SoyLatte, a port of the BSD port to MacOSX.  A bit of work lies ahead of those efforts, as only early parts of an Aqua UI interface are present, and only the X11 interface is expected to run smoothly.
