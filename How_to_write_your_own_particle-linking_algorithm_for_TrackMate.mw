== Introduction. ==

This last part on particle-linking modules concludes the series of tutorials on extending TrackMate. The most difficult modules to create are spot detectors, which was the subject of the [[How to write your own detection algorithm for TrackMate|previous tutorial]]. Particle-linking modules, or trackers, are a little bit less complicated. 

However, you still need to understand how we store and manipulate links in TrackMate, and this implies very briefly introducing mathematical graphs.

== Simple, undirected graphs. ==
