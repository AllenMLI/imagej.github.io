ImageJ is easy to use, but sometimes you wish for some function that is actually implemented, yet you do not know how to trigger.  This page lists a few of those tricks.

= Show the memory consumption =

Just click on the status bar, and you will see how much memory is used, and how much memory is available.

= Execute external programs =

The macro language allows executing programs, and capturing their output:

 output = exec("dir /w");

= Quickly see return values =

You do not need to wrap calls into write() calls: if you just write something like

 getDirectory("plugins");

the return value will appear in your Log window when called.
