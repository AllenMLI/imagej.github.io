ImageJ is easy to use, but sometimes you wish for some function that is actually implemented, yet you do not know how to trigger.  This page lists a few of those tricks.

==Show the memory consumption==

Just click on the status bar, and you will see how much memory is used, and how much memory is available.

==Execute external programs==

The macro language allows executing programs, and capturing their output:

 output = exec("dir /w");

==Quickly see return values==

You do not need to wrap macro calls into write() calls: if you just write something like

 getDirectory("plugins");

the return value will appear in your Log window when called.

==Find out in which menu (or .jar file) a certain command is==

Hit {{key|Ctrl}}+{{key|L}} to start the command launcher.  Type (part of) the name of the entry, then click on ''Show full information''.

If ''{{bc | Edit | Options | Misc...}}>Require command key for shortcuts'' is ''un''checked, typing {{key|L}} is sufficient.

==Put the main window to the foreground==

Pressing the {{key|Return}} key on any image will bring the main window to the foreground.

==Close all images (without being asked whether to save them)==

{{bc | Plugins | Utilities | Close All Without Saving}}

== Set the foreground color ==

Double-click on the pipette, or hit {{key|Ctrl}}+{{key|Shift}}+{{key|K}} (on Macs, it is {{key|Cmd}}+{{key|Shift}}+{{key|K}}), or select the menu item ''{{bc | Image | Color | Color Picker...}}"

== Set the line width ==

Line selections can have a width larger than one, which also has an effect on line profiles.  You can set it by double clicking on the line selection tool, or by calling {{bc | Edit | Options | Line Width...}}

== Quickly copy a ROI from one image to another ==

Simply activate the image with the desired ROI, then the image you want to put that ROI into, and hit {{key|Ctrl}}+{{key|Shift}}+{{key|E}}. This triggers the {{bc | Edit | Selection | Restore Selection}} which "restores" the selection.
