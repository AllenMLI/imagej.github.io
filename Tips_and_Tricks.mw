ImageJ is easy to use, but sometimes you wish for some function that is actually implemented, yet you do not know how to trigger.  This page lists a few of those tricks.

==Show the memory consumption==

Just click on the status bar, and you will see how much memory is used, and how much memory is available.

==Execute external programs==

The macro language allows executing programs, and capturing their output:

 output = exec("dir /w");

==Quickly see return values==

You do not need to wrap calls into write() calls: if you just write something like

 getDirectory("plugins");

the return value will appear in your Log window when called.

==Find out in which menu (or .jar file) a certain command is==

Hit '''Ctrl+L''' (or '''Cmd+L''' on Macs) to start the command launcher.  Type (part of) the name of the entry, then click on ''Show full information''.

If ''Edit>Options>Misc...>Require command key for shortcuts'' is ''un''checked, typing '''L''' is sufficient.

==Put the main window to the foreground==

Pressing the Return key on any image will bring the main window to the foreground.

==Close all images (without being asked whether to save them)==

''Plugins>Utilities>Close All Without Saving''
