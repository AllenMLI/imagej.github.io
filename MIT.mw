__NOTOC__{{Notice | For a summary of [[SciJava]] licensing, see the [[Licensing]] page.}}
{{Licenses}}The '''MIT License''' is a '''permissive''' [[Open Source|free software]] license, imposing minimal restrictions on the redistribution of covered software. This is in contrast to [[wikipedia:Copyleft|copyleft]] licenses like the [[GPL]], which have reciprocity share-alike requirements. The MIT license is named for the [http://mit.edu/ Massachusetts Institute of Technology], where it originated.

See the [[wikipedia:MIT License|Wikipedia article on the MIT license]] for more information.
