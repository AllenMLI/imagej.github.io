[[TrakEM2]] has been updated to version 0.7i

Please call "Help - Update Fiji" to get the new TrakEM2_.jar and updated dependency jars into your plugins folder.

The update includes:

*Manual non-linear registration mode, multi-tile.
*Region growing via Erwin Frise's fast marching implemention in the [[Level Sets|Level Sets library]]. Just select an AreaList and click anywhere on an image using the pencil tool. Adjust algorithm parameters via right-click "Display - Adjust fast-marching parameters...". 
*Preprocessor scripts in jython, javascript and beanshell.
*Grid overlays in calibrated units.
*Speedups for label importing from tif or amira into AreaList.

And many more. See [http://t2.ini.uzh.ch/trakem2.html all TrakEM2 0.7i new features and fixes].

The new manual non-linear transform mode is mostly the work of [http://fly.mpi-cbg.de/saalfeld Stephan Saalfeld].
