Fiji is a community effort.  So we are happy whenever we see new people developing Fiji!

== Purpose ==

The purpose of this tutorial is to get you started hacking on [https://github.com/fiji/ Fiji's source code] (i.e., the core Fiji plugins). If you need to develop a ''new plugin'' for ImageJ, you do not actually need Fiji's source. Rather, see these resources:
* {{GitHub|org=imagej|repo=example-legacy-plugin|label=example-legacy-plugin}} project template
* [[Introduction into Developing Plugins]] tutorial
* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac-6gJ2eRb0 Developing ImageJ 1.x plugins with NetBeans] screencast

See also [[Developing Fiji in Eclipse]] for a tutorial specific to the Eclipse IDE.

== Getting started ==

First, you have to [[Downloading_and_Building_Fiji_From_Source|download and build Fiji]]. If you do not know Git yet, we have a [[Git for dummies|concise introduction]] for you.

== Building Fiji ==

Fiji is organized into a set of [[Maven]] projects. For convenience and speed, there is [[SciJava]]'s minimal Maven-lookalike [[MiniMaven]] to build Fiji, but it is recommended to use an [[IDEs|Integrated Development Environment]], or at least real Maven.

For details, please see [[Downloading and Building Fiji From Source]].
See also the [[Supported Compilers]] page for more information.

== Testing ==

It is strongly recommended to write regression tests (also known as ''unit tests''). It is [[Fiji_contribution_requirements#Regression_tests|easy]].

Furthermore, it is highly recommended to write and run unit tests in an [[IDEs|Integrated Development Environment]] for efficient debugging.

You may also want to measure the code coverage of your tests - one way is described in the page [[Code Coverage in Fiji]].

At some point, you might want to debug whatever you wrote.  There's a small [[Debugging intro]] page.

== Discussing code ==

When you want to propose and/or discuss changes to some source code, the preferred way is to [[contributing|submit a PR on GitHub]].

== Contributing ==

Please have a look at the excellent ''[[How to contribute to an existing plugin or library]]'' tutorial.

== Providing documentation ==

A plugin wants to be used. Therefore you want to give users some information about it, and most likely also a tutorial how to use it.

If you have an account on this Wiki, you can easily create new tutorials with the [[Tutorial Maker]].
