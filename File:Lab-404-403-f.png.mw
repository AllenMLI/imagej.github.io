==MOPS feature correspondences (example 2)==

A lab shelf imaged from different viewpoints approximated by a 2d-affine mapping.  Automatically extracted landmark correspondences using the MOPS descriptor are overlaid. One example and its respective descriptors are shown. The upper left corner of the descriptor patch is marked with an arrow.  Note that the implementation performs well even in presence of moderate 3d-viewpoint change that introduces variance in occlusion.  See also [[:Image:Tem-42-33-f.png|example 1]].
