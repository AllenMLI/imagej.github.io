{{Notice | This page presents exercises for ''software developers'' to use for debugging ImageJ.<br>If you are a ''user'' looking to troubleshoot issues, see the [[Troubleshooting]] page.}}

[[Debugging]] is the art of determining the cause and/or location of a problem. The purpose of this guide is to provide developers practical, hands-on experience using a variety of debugging techniques to identify problems in code.

= Requirements =

As ImageJ is built using the [[Project_management|SciJava principles of project management]], this guide assumes a basic familiarity with these topics and tools, especially:
* [[Git]]
* [[Maven]]

Additionally, you should:
* Install an IDE - this guide is written with [[Eclipse]] in mind.
* If using Eclipse, install the [https://eclipse.org/mat/ memory analyzer plugin].
* Clone the [https://github.com/imagej/imagej-troubleshooting imagej-troubleshooting] companion repository, which this guide is designed around, and import it as a Maven project into your IDE.
* Install the [https://visualvm.java.net/ jvisualvm] tool.

Finally, you should read the [http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseDebugging/article.html#usedebug Debugging in Eclipse] section, at least, of Lars Vogel's [http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseDebugging/article.html Eclipse tutorial]. Note that there is significant overlap between the topics covered between these tutorials. Vogel's guide does a fantastic job of laying out the debugging interface and tools in Eclipse, while this guide focuses on providing hands-on practice and explaining the reasoning for when to use these tools.

'''If you find yourself confused''' when this tutorial asks you to do something in Eclipse (e.g. "start debugging", "step into") it's almost certainly covered in [http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseDebugging/article.html#usedebug Vogel's guide].

= What not to do: print statements =

For many developers, the first tool in their debugging toolbox is the print statement. Print statements are easy to lean on as a safety crutch: you don't need any special knowledge to use them, and they often work to answer common questions (e.g. "why is this variable null here?", "how many elements are in my array here?").

However, there are critical drawbacks to trying to debug via print statement:
* They are slow. If you realize you need to move or add a print statement, you need to recompile your code and re-launch your application.
* They are part of the code. Adding print statements changes line numbers, causes git to pick up modifications to the source code, and can even affect performance and/or behavior.
* They are limited. Even the most basic breakpoint and expression evaluation in Eclipse debug mode gives you vastly more power and flexibility over print statements.

Learning to use debugging tools is, understandably, a burden: it's "one more thing" to learn as a developer. But if you want to develop ImageJ plugins, you will almost certainly run into cases where debugging is necessary. So you may as well start familiarizing yourself with the tools now, gaining skills and perspectives that will serve you well throughout your career.

= Using this guide =

Remember the goal of these exercises is not to ''solve'' the problems, but to learn how and when to use the myriad of troubleshooting techniques available. Given the inherent complexity that comes with a combined work, all of these techniques have their time and place when working on a rich application like [[ImageJ]].

Because this project is intended to help new developers practice troubleshooting skills, it uses contrived examples, limited in complexity. If you have complete, perfect knowledge of the code then there isn't really a need for troubleshooting, as it is trivial to see why something is behaving incorrectly. Thus the source of these exercises is divided into <code>hidden</code> and <code>visible</code> packages. Users are strongly recommended to only inspect and set breakpoints from the <code>visible</code> classes. From a development point of view, consider the <code>hidden</code> package a 3rd-party library that you may not have control over.

Changing the source code to actually fix the bugs is outside the scope of this guide, but motivated users are of course welcome to do so for practice.

'''If at any time''' you need to revert changes to this repository, you can always do so via the command:

<source lang="bash">
git reset --hard origin/master

=Exercises=

==Exercise 1: Breakpoints==

'''Goals'''

* Practice setting breakpoints in Eclipse
* Use the Variables window to inspect variable values
* Use the navigation commands to traverse code while in Debug mode


The first thing we want to do is open the source file, <code>E1BasicBreakpoints</code>, and ''run'' it to get an idea of what's going on. We should see a simple stack trace:


[[File:E1StackTrace.png]]


Stack traces are a common starting point for debugging, as they indicate something has gone wrong in Java that the program was not prepared to handle. In this case, the stack trace tells us we know the ''what'' (tried to use a <code>null</code> object) and the ''where'' (the topmost line number), but not ''why'' the object was <code>null</code> at that point - the actual root cause of the exception.

To investigate further, try to complete the following debugging steps:
# Set a breakpoint in the <code>main</code> method, before <code>makeAThing</code> is called
# ''Debug'' the file as a Java application
# When the breakpoint is encountered, ''step in'' to the <code>makeAThing</code> method
# ''step over'' the line constructing a new <code>Object</code>
# ''step out'' of the <code>makeAThing</code> method
# In the ''Variables'' window, look at the value of the Object variable
# 'resume' execution until the program completes


{{ExpandingBox
| Now that you've walked through the program, do you know ''why'' we got a <code>NullPointerException</code>?
| > Although <code>makeAThing</code> does create an new Object, that Object isn't actually returned by the method.
}}

==Exercise 2: Expressions==

'''Goals'''

* Set breakpoints on exception creation
* Use the ''Expressions'' window to evaluate code at runtime


Start by opening the <code>E2EffectiveExpressions</code> source and running it. Like the previous exercise, we have a stack trace to start from:


[[File:E2StackTrace.png]]


Try setting a breakpoint on the conditional line:

<source lang="java">if (index < 0 || index >= list.size()) {</source>


{{ExpandingBox
| Try debugging now, using ''Resume'' any time a breakpoint is encountered. How many times do you hit a breakpoint?
| >Three times. This is because we're debugging inside a method that is used multiple times in our program.
}}


Since we are only interested in the <code>processElementAtIndex</code> method when a problem actually occurs, let's try something different:

[[File:E2BreakOnException.png|right|600px|thumb|Setting a breakpoint on an exception]]
# From the ''Breakpoints'' window in the ''Debug'' perspective, delete the old breakpoint
# Now use the ''Add Java Exception Breakpoint'' button to add a breakpoint to ''IllegalArgumentException''
# Debug the program. When it stops, inspect the ''Variables'' window.
[[File:E2Variables.png|right|600px|thumb|Inspecting the variables window]]

At this point, we know there is a problem accessing the <code>99999th</code> element of the list, but the variables window doesn't tell us exactly what the problem is. We can manually expand and explore the <code>list</code> variable - but given its size that could be cumbersome.

Instead, let's use expressions. If it's not already visible, open the ''Window > Show View > Expressions'' view.

In this view, we can add any number of Java expressions to evaluate. We can call methods from, and on, any variables and classes visible from the current scope.

'''Warning:''' if you evaluate expressions that change the state of variables, for example <code>List.add</code>, then those changes '''will''' persist. Sometimes you do legitimately need to alter the state of variables while debugging (for example, to force the conditions in which a bug appears). Just be aware that you could also be ''introducing'' problematic behavior when evaluating expressions.

To complete this exercise:
# Write an expression that calls the <code>size()</code> method of our list.
# Write a 2nd expression that evaluates to the value of the <code>index</code> variable


{{ExpandingBox
| Once you've evaluated these expressions, can you tell what went wrong in the program?
| >We asked for a list of size 100,000 but a list of size 99,999 came back. Since we used hard-coded indices, instead of size-relative (e.g. <code>list.size()-1</code>), a method was called wanting to access a non-existent element.
}}

==Exercise 3: Conditional breakpoints==

'''Goals'''

* Create a breakpoint that triggers after a specified number of hits
* Create a breakpoint that triggers when a certain condition is true



Start by opening the <code>E3ConditionalCrisis</code> source and running it. This time our console output looks a bit different:

[[File:E3StackTrace.png]]


In addition to the exception stack trace, the program itself appears to have found an invalid object, causing the processing to go unfinished. Although we could set a breakpoint on the exception, as we did in [[#Exercise 2: Expressions|exercise 2]], the exception is actually happening ''after'' the more interesting part of the program - the loop. As we learned in exercise 2, breakpoints in code that is called repeatedly are annoying, so let's see what we can find by attaching conditions to our breakpoint.

First set a breakpoint on the line ''after'' the <code>everythingIsOK</code> assignment:
<source lang=java>
everythingIsOK = ObjectAnalyzer.processElementAtIndex(myArray, i);
i++;
</source>

Then try the following:

[[File:E3CountBreakpoint.png|350px|right|thumb|Setting a hit count]]
# Open the ''Breakpoints'' window
# Right-click our breakpoint and select ''Breakpoint Properties...''
# Check the ''Hit Count'' box and set it to the object number printed in the error message.
# Try debugging


{{ExpandingBox
| Was there a problem with the current object when/if your breakpoint is hit?
| >If there was, try it again! In this exercise, the "broken" object index is non-deterministic - so it is unlikely to be exactly the same index two runs in a row.
>If the broken object appears later the second time, your breakpoint will hit but the current object will likely be fine.
>If the "broken" object appears earlier the second time, your breakpoint won't be hit at all.
}}


Using <code>count</code>-based conditional breakpoints can be very useful if the error is deterministic. In this case we need to try something different. We know the <code>everythingIsOK</code> flag reflects the integrity of the object at a given index - so what we really want to use here is a breakpoint that stops in the loop when the <code>everythingIsOK</code> flag is set to false:

[[File:E3ConditionalBreakpoint.png|350px|right|thumb|Setting a conditional expression]]
# Open the ''Breakpoints'' window again
# Open the properties of our breakpoint
# Uncheck the ''Hit Count'' box
# Check the ''Conditional'' box, and "Suspend when 'true'"
# Enter the condition we want to check (any Java conditional statement can be used here)
# Try debugging again

Were you able to get the breakpoint to stop in the loop only when a problem is encountered?


{{ExpandingBox
| What was suspicious about the object at that index?
| >The object was <code>null</code>.
}}

==Exercise 4: ImageJ plugins==

'''Goals'''

* Start a debugging session in Eclipse that connects to a running ImageJ instance


Exercises 1-3 are abstract, self-contained programs. The <code>E4RemoteResearch</code> class, on the other hand, is an actual ImageJ [[Writing_plugins#What_is_a_.22plugin.22.3F|plugin]]. Although plugin developers typically set up tests to run their plugin within ImageJ, it is impossible to test all possible runtime environments: users could have a variety of [[Update Sites|update sites]] enabled, custom plugins installed, etc... and each modification is an opportunity for dependency skew and clashes with your plugin. When problems do arise, it is invaluable to have the ability to debug a running copy of ImageJ itself.

<code>E4RemoteResearch</code> does still have a <code>main</code> method to demonstrate the expected output for this plugin - in this case, simply printing the concrete implementation of the <code>ConsoleService</code>. Run the class in Eclipse and you should see some simple output in the console:

<source>I found our console service! Look: class org.scijava.console.DefaultConsoleService</source>

Next, we want to run this plugin in ImageJ and see what happens:

# On the command line, run <code>mvn clean install</code> from the <code>imagej-troubleshooting</code> directory, to build a <code>.jar</code>
# Copy the produced jar (e.g. <code>target/imagej-troubleshooting-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar</code>) to the <code>ImageJ.app/jars</code> directory of your ImageJ installation
# Start ImageJ

Note that the menu path of the plugin is specified in the class's annotation:

<source lang=java>
@Plugin(type = Command.class,menuPath = "Plugins>Troubleshooting>E4 - Print ConsoleService")
</source>

So, you can now run the <code>E4 - Print ConsoleService</code> command either via the menus or [[Command_Finder|command finder]]. You should get an exception:

[[File:E4StackTrace.png]]

In order to connect Eclipse to ImageJ, we need to close our running instance and restart from the command line, setting the [[Debugging#Attaching_to_ImageJ_instances|debug flag]], e.g.:

<source>
ImageJ.app/ImageJ-linux64 --debugger=8000
</source>
[[File:E4DebugConfig.png|400px|right|thumb|Remote Java Application debug configuration]]
This will start up ImageJ in a mode that's able to communicate with Eclipse. Next we need to connect Eclipse to the running ImageJ instance:

# Right-click the <code>E4RemoteResearch</code> source file in the Package Explorer
# Select <code>Debug As > Debug Configurations...</code>
# Scroll down the list of configurations (or search) until you find <code>Remote Java Application</code>
# Double-click <code>Remote Java Application</code> to create the debug configuration
# Rename the configuration to <code>E4RemoteResearch-remote</code> to distinguish it. If necessary you can update the port to match what was specified when you started ImageJ.
# Click the <code>Debug</code> button to start a remote debugging session

At this point ImageJ and Eclipse should be communicating. It's important to understand that the information flow goes from ImageJ to Eclipse: ImageJ says "I am at line number X in class Y" and if Eclipse looks in the source files it knows about, and stops if it finds a breakpoint at that location.

'''However''', when Eclipse looks at its source files, it's not looking at the ''actual'' classes that were used to launch the remote Application. In fact, the classes Eclipse looks in depend entirely on the classpath of the project ''that was used to start the remote debugging session''. So when you are remote debugging, there are two best practices to follow:
* Launch the remote session from the project you're interested in (if you want to debug a class in <code>scijava-common</code>, don't start the session from the <code>imagej-legacy</code> project) 
* Make sure the source in Eclipse matches what's in the remote application (an easy way to guarantee this is to build the <code>.jar</code> and copy it to the application)

Since we already followed these best practices, we can now finally debug our plugin:
# In Eclipse, set a breakpoint on the line where the <code>ConsoleService> is being cast to <code>DefualtConsoleService</code>
# In ImageJ, run the <code>E4 - Print ConsoleService</code> command
# In Eclipse, when the breakpoint is hit, inspect the value of the <code>consoleService</code> field


{{ExpandingBox
| What is the class of <code>consoleService</code>?
| >It's a <code>LegacyConsoleService</code>.
}}

{{ExpandingBox
| Extra credit: why did this plugin work when we ran its <code>main</code> method, but not in ImageJ?
| >The <code>Context</code> in the <code>main</code> method is built with only one <code>ConsoleService</code> implementation available - <code>DefaultConsoleService</code>. In the full <code>Context</code> used in ImageJ, a higher-priority <code>LegacyConsoleService</code> overrides the <code>DefaultConsoleService</code>.
}}


==Exercise 5: Git history==

'''Goals'''

* Practice using [https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect git bisect] to locate historical breakages

Debugging code directly via the techniques we've discussed thus far is not always practical. If the code is excessively complex, or the problem subtle, it may not be practical to try and step through code execution - you may not even be sure where to start. Keeping code well-structured and well-documented can help here, but we have another resource to draw on: the history of changes to our code, via git commits - assuming [[Development_Lifecycle|appropriate development practices]] are used. Identifying the breaking change gives us more information to use in our diagnosis (and in some cases, can be fixed with a simple [https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert git revert]]).

So, the first thing we'll do is run the <code>E5HistoricalHysteria</code> class and verify that it fails. For this exercise we have some additional information: this class used to run successfully, and a [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging tag] was made at that point.

To find what tags are available, on the command line we can run:

<source>
$ hinerm@Nyarlathotep ~/code/imagej/imagej-troubleshooting (master)
git fetch --tags

$ hinerm@Nyarlathotep ~/code/imagej/imagej-troubleshooting (master)
git tag -l
e5-good-maths
</source>

The purpose of the <code>bisect</code> tool is to search our commit history to find the breaking commit. Although you could search one by one through the commit history, this would take [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity#Linear_time linear time] in proportion to the number of commits to search. Bisecting performs a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm#Performance binary search], speeding up the process significantly. It also allows much of the process to be automated.

To use the bisect tool we just need to know two commits: one where the test worked, and one where the test failed. In this case, we know the <code>e5-good-maths</code> tag worked, and our current state is broken, so we can start the bisect:

<source>
$ hinerm@Nyarlathotep ~/code/imagej/imagej-troubleshooting (master)
git bisect start master e5-good-maths
Bisecting: 9 revisions left to test after this (roughly 3 steps)
[d2e45589ca3671c93f772d4310fed9653ca1569b] E5: Zach likes the maths!
$ hinerm@Nyarlathotep ~/code/imagej/imagej-troubleshooting ((d2e4558...)|BISECTING)
</source>

In each step of the bisect git will automatically move you to a new commit to be tested. "Testing" simply involves trying to reproduce the error and letting git know if this commit is good or bad. While bisecting, the whole local repository is in a special "BISECTING" mode - so that git can remember your answers for each commit. If you ever make a mistake (marking a commit incorrectly) you can abort the process via <code>git bisect reset</code>.

Now that you're bisecting, follow these steps until you've identified the failing commit:
# In Eclipse, refresh the <code>imagej-troubleshooting</code> project, to ensure that the current commit is what's being tested
# Run the <code>E5HistoricalHysteria</code> class
# On the command line, use either <code>git bisect bad</code> or <code>git bisect good</code> depending on if an exception was thrown or not

After marking the last commit good or bad, bisect will print out the first bad commit. You can use <code>git bisect reset</code> to finish bisecting.


{{ExpandingBox

=What next?=

At the start of this guide we mentioned that the goal of debugging isn't explicitly to fix the problem. So a natural question that follows is - once we've successfully identified the cause of an issue (or at least narrowed things down), what are the next steps to take?

The answer depends on the debugging developer's skill and responsibilities, and whether or not they have identified a fix (a fix is often easy to come up with once the problem is identified).

If a fix is identified:

* If you are a maintainer of the component you can make the fix directly, or use a [[Git_topic_branches|topic branch]] if the fix needs discussion first.
* If you do not have commit rights to the repository, you can [[How_to_contribute_to_an_existing_plugin_or_library|contribute the fix]] via pull request

If a fix is unclear:

* Use any of the standard [[Help|channels for help]].

Even if you can't contribute a fix, if you went through the effort of debugging - at the very list you should identify the problem, steps you took to debug, and potential fix(es) via a [[Report_a_Bug|bug report]] so that your effort is not lost.
