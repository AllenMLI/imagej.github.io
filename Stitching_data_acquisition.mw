To begin stitching, you must first create a dataset that contains the correct format that the Fiji Stitching plugin can identify and analyze. Currently, Fiji supports formats from two systems of microscope, which are Wiscan and Prairie. 
 
== Wiscan Data Acquisition ==
For basic Wiscan data acquisition, the following steps will allow for a correct datasets:
*Check to make sure the microscope is in the correct startup setup
*Log into Wiscan with the given username and password
*Depending on the two Wiscan devices:
**Turn on machines 1-8 (Microscope 1)
**Turn on the pockle cell machine and the light reader (Microscope 2)
