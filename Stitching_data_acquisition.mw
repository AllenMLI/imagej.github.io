To begin stitching, you must first create a dataset that contains the correct format that the Fiji Stitching plugin can identify and analyze. Currently, Fiji supports formats from two systems of microscope, which are Wiscan and Prairie. 
 
== Wiscan Data Acquisition ==
<ol>
<li>Make sure the image being used has been set up correctly:
<ol>
<li>Ensure the the outer shutter lever is pointing towards image and the inner shutter lever is pointing towards the computer</li>

<li>Turn on the external xyz manipulator</li>

*NOTE: Do not attempt to adjust the focus of the image with the manual knob. You will wear down the gears. </ol>

<li>Log in to Wiscan</li>

<li>Start Scan and ensure your image is in focus on the left side of your screen<\li>

<li>Use the joystick to choose your initial image frame</li>

<li>Adjust the pockle cell dials until you can see an image on the right side of your screen (the blue portion)</li>

<li>Turn on the __ . Increase the number until a very small amount of red can be seen in your image</li>

*NOTE: Ensure only a small amount of red can be seen in the frame of your image. If too much of a contrast is present, it will burn out the microscope's laser

 <li>Stop scan</li>

 <li>Define the start position in your metadata by selecting "manual update" then "set 0"</li>

 <li>Generate the specifics of your image acquisition by selecting "generate"</li>

<li>Set the size of each image taken (in microns)</li>

<li>Set the amount of overlap you wish to have in your image, then press "calculate number of positions"</li>

*NOTE- You can also set your own step size and overlap amount and calculate the size of each image

<li>Once you have calculated all the necessary positions, you can save this data using the "save positions" button and load them back into Wiscan at a later date</li>

<li>Select Z motor</li>

<li>under 4d imaging, calculate Z bottom, Z top, and Z step</li>

<li>These numbers should be set as 0 unless you are imaging in more than one plane of your sample</li>

<li>Select "Use XY coordinates" and then start sequence</li>

<li>Once Wiscan has run, your output will be a series of images that can be stitched together.</li>

*NOTE- If an noticeable amount of overlay can be seen in your images, there is a pixel to micron error within the microscope's initial setup. To fix this, recalibrate the microscope's objectives.
