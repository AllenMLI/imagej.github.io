To begin stitching, you must first create a dataset that contains the correct format that the Fiji Stitching plugin can identify and analyze. Currently, Fiji supports formats from two systems of microscope, which are Wiscan and Prairie.

Make sure the image being used has been set up correctly:

Ensure the the outer shutter lever is pointing towards image and the inner shutter lever is pointing towards the computer

Turn on the external xyz manipulator

NOTE: Do not attempt to adjust the focus of the image with the manual knob. You will wear down the gears.

Log in to Wiscan

Start Scan and ensure your image is in focus on the left side of your screen

Use the joystick to choose your initial image frame

Adjust the pockle cell dials until you can see an image on the right side of your screen (the blue portion)

Turn on the __ . Increase the number until a very small amount of red can be seen in your image

NOTE: Ensure only a small amount of red can be seen in the frame of your image. If too much of a contrast is present, it will burn out the microscope's laser

 Stop scan

 Define the start position in your metadata by selecting "manual update" then "set 0"

 Generate the specifics of your image acquisition by selecting "generate"

Set the size of each image taken (in microns)

Set the amount of overlap you wish to have in your image, then press "calculate number of positions"

NOTE- You can also set your own step size and overlap amount and calculate the size of each image

Once you have calculated all the necessary positions, you can save this data using the "save positions" button and load them back into Wiscan at a later date

Select Z motor

under 4d imaging, calculate Z bottom, Z top, and Z step

 These numbers should be set as 0 unless you are imaging in more than one plane of your sample

Select "Use XY coordinates" and then start sequence

Once Wiscan has run, your output will be a series of images that can be stitched together. 

NOTE- If an noticeable amount of overlay can be seen in your images, there is a pixel to micron error within the microscope's initial setup. To fix this, recalibrate the microscope's objectives.
