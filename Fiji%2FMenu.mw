* '''Rigid Registration''':
* '''Moving Least Squares''': Given two sets of points in two images, register one image to the other according to the point correspondences. You can define the points manually with Point Roi (just click and hold shift to add more than one point), and also from a script. See [[Moving Least Squares]].

* '''Stiching (2D/3D)''': Given any number of stacks, stitch them together (translation only, but in X, Y <i>and</i> Z axes) and apply smooth intensity blending in the overlapping areas. Very useful for joining confocal stacks. If only two stacks are registered it accepts retangular ROIs in each stack to limit the area to search into, for more than two stacks/images a tile configuration has to be created. For more information see [[Stitching 2D/3D]].

=== Stacks ===

<i>If we keep this option, I think it should be restricted to plugins that operate a stack but which don't care about the content, e.g. those for cropping or reslicing.  (At least there needs to be some distinction since practically every plugin operates on stacks.)</i>

* '''[[Stitching_2D/3D|3D Stitching]]''': Stitch two image stacks (3D), rectangular ROIs can be used to limit the area to search in as well.
* '''[[Stitching_2D/3D|Stitch Grid of Images]]''': Stitch an arbitrary number of 2D or 3D images (i.e. stacks) which are arranged in a regular grid (e.g. 4 x 3 images with roughly 10% overlap)
* '''[[Stitching_2D/3D|Stitch Collection of Images]]''': Stitch an arbitrary number of 2D or 3D images (i.e. stacks) which do not have to be in a regular grid. The rough initial configuration (which image is overlapping another one) is given in tile configuration file.

Non-destructive stitching is available via [[TrakEM2]] (i.e. floating, adjustable images).
