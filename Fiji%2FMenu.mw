The hierarchy of the Plugins Menu is show here, with a few words of explanation for each plugin and links to more documentation where available.  If you know about a plugin that is in this list, but which doesn't yet have a description, please add it.  Also please update this page if you change the menu structure in any way.

<i>FIXME: ideally we should generate this page automatically from the fiji source tree...</i>
