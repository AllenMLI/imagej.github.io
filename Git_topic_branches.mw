Topic branches are small-scale branches used for trying out new ideas.  Working on such a branch rather than directly on the master branch makes it easier to:
* keep track of and then submit changes
* work on several ideas at once
* throw stuff away that didn't work
* keep your work in progress up to date (and yet clearly separable from) changes to the master branch (using git rebase)
For me the ability to work like this has been perhaps the major innovation of using git. 

Until Johannes puts something of his own up, you can try google or see e.g [http://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec-dev/wikis/topic-branches this post by Wincent Colaiuta] on this topic.
