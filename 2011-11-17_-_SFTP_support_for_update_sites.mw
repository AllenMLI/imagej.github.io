Thanks to [http://ij-plugins.sourceforge.net/ Jarek Sacha], our [[Fiji Updater]] now has support for SFTP in addition to SSH. Many sites do not allow for direct SSH access but only for SFTP, like [http://sourceforge.net SourceForge]. Now we support such sites, too!

To enable SFTP support, just prefix ''sftp:'' in front of the SSH host in the [[Adding Update Sites|update site configuration]].
