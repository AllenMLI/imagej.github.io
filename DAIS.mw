The Dresden Analysis-of-Images Suite ([http://dais.bioimagecomputing.com DAIS]) is a partner project in the German Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure ([https://www.denbi.de de.NBI)].
The [[Fiji]] community is actively working towards tight integration with the [[KNIME]] workflow engine, which is maintained and developed by the de.NBI center CIBI. DAIS has a strong focus on further strengthening interoperability and integration of Fiji and KNIME, as well as bringing together their respective developer communities.

{{Notice | message=If you are a Fiji user within the de.NBI network, we kindly ask for your feedback through [https://www.surveymonkey.de/r/denbi-service?sc=cibi&tool=fiji this survey].}}
