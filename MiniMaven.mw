MiniMaven is a minimal build and dependency management system. It reads project configurations in the same format as [[Maven]] (''pom.xml'' files).

== Why MiniMaven? ==

The only reason for MiniMaven to exist is that Maven -- while powerful -- is also pretty resource-hungry. In contrast to MiniMaven, Maven requires many more CPU cycles, takes longer, and downloads many more bytes (due to downloading and running requiring Maven plugins and their dependencies).

Therefore we needed a system to build ImageJ1, ImageJ2 and Fiji quickly from the same type of project description files as Maven interprets, to be maximally flexible and interoperable.
