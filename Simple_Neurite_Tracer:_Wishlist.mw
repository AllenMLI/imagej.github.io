This is a list of the most commonly requested (or most important) wishlist items for Simple Neurite Tracer.

* You should be able to do all the basic tracing operations in the 3D Viewer.  e.g. selecting the start point, selecting the subsequent points, and creating joins and branches.  This is partially implemented now - you can try switching between the "hand" and "wand" tool and clicking in the 3D viewer.  There's no visual feedback yet for what you're doing, however.  Ideally it would be nice not to have to switch tool, as well

* You should be able to merge branches that meet at a single point.  This is important for when people forget to use the join modifier when creating a branch.  The suggested course of action is to go back and create a tiny joining path between the original process and the branch.  However, to avoid having this additional tiny branch, it would be best to be able to merge them.

* You should be able to split paths.

* It would be nice to optionally colour the paths by their SWC type.

* Path finding and filling are very memory hungry in large stacks.  The data structures for storing the progress of these searches should be much more efficient.

* It would be nice to be able to export paths to NeuroML as well as SWC.

* The "fit volume" option is rather naive, and doesn't work well for noisy stacks.  For clear processes it's still a nice way to visualize the traces, but it should be replaced by a better algorithm.

* The "fill volume" option works well, but currently isn't rendered in the 3D viewer and doesn't calculate radii around the path for export.  It would be useful to fit spheres within the fill to optimize the midpoint and generate radii.
