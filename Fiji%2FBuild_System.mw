The goal of Fiji's build system is to make it extremely simple to define the tasks that are needed for Fiji.

To accomplish that, Fiji uses [[MiniMaven]], a cut-down clone of [[Maven]].

= Command-line interface =

If you want to build Fiji completely, just clone ''git://github.com/fiji/fiji'', change the directory to the cloned one, and launch:

<source lang="bash">
./Build.sh
</source>

== Command-line options == 

You can add individual targets (versions in versioned file names are ignored), e.g.:

<source lang="bash">
./Build.sh jars/fiji-compat.jar
</source>

If you want to force a rebuild, just attach the suffix ''--rebuild'' to the file name:

<source lang="bash">
./Build.sh jars/fiji-compat.jar-rebuild
</source>

The special ''clean'' target deletes all artifacts and intermediate build products:

<source lang="bash">
./Build.sh clean
</source>

= History =

There used to be a custom build system for Fiji called "Fiji Build", but it became unmaintainable and always had the rather big shortcoming of not integrating well with integrated development environments such as Netbeans, Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc. It has been deprecated in January 2013.
