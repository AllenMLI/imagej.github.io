{{Warning | This is an experimental plugin, and I have doubts about its correctness—in particular, the results are strange when the ratio of pixelWidth : pixelHeight : pixelDepth is other than 1:1:1.  In addition, the results in any case seem to be different from those from other implementations, such as [http://www.mathworks.co.uk/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24409-hessian-based-frangi-vesselness-filter this [[MATLAB]] one].   I don't have time to work on this any more (and no longer work in academia at all) so if someone were interested in taking it over, that would be brilliant.}}

This plugin implements the algorithm for detection of vessel- or tube-like structures in 2D and 3D images described Frangi et al 1998. <ref>{{cite journal|author=Alejandro F. Frangi, Wiro J. Niessen, Koen L. Vinc and Max A. Viergever|title=Multiscale Vessel Enhancement Filtering|journal=Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Interventation — MICCAI’98 Lecture Notes in Computer Science|year=1998|volume=1496/1998|page=130|url=http://www.tecn.upf.es/~afrangi/articles/miccai1998.pdf}}</ref>

In my experience, this method produces consistently better results than the [[Tubeness]] plugin for isotropic image data, although it is significantly slower.

These screenshots show the results on an example file:
