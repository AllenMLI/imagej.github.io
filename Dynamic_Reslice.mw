== Purpose ==


This plugin is simply a dynamic version of the Reslice command as it is in
ImageJ version 1.42l, by Patrick Kelly, Harvey Karten, Wayne Rasband, Julian
Cooper and Adrian Deerr. It draws an orthogonal slice through the volume
represented by the stack it is applied on along its ROI, and update
dynamically this slice as the ROI is displaced or deformed. As it is based on
the Reslice command, it implements all of the later feature, excepting the 
multi-slice output.
