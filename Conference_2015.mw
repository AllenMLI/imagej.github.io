== Call for abstracts ==
[https://warf.wufoo.com/forms/x28h3or1xv2l8c/ Submissions] from the ImageJ community are warmly encouraged:

* '''Workshops.''' Workshops will be 60 - 120 minutes, and may cover any ImageJ-related topic.
* '''Posters.''' The conference will offer a scientific poster session in parallel with workshops and invited talks. Posters may cover any ImageJ-related topic.

In all formats, material may focus on the novice ImageJ user, or on special, dedicated topics for the advanced user.
