== General Description ==
This plugin tags all pixel/voxels in a skeleton image and then counts all its junctions and branches and measures their average length. The tags are shown in a new window displaying every tag in a different color. See [[Skeletonize3D]] for an example of how to produce skeleton images.

The voxels are classified into three different categories depending on their 26 neighbors:
* '''End-point''' voxels: if the have less than 2 neighbors.
* '''Junction''' voxels: if the have more than 2 neighbors.
* '''Slab''' voxels: if the have exactly 2 neighbors.
Let's see an example of this classification:

|style="vertical-align:top" |[[Image:Tagging_example.png|thumb|292px|Example of voxel classification]]
|}

End-point voxels are displayed in '''blue''', slab voxels in '''orange''' and junction voxels in '''purple'''.

After classification, a "Results" window is displayed showing the number voxels of every type, the number of branches, the actual number of junctions and the average length of branches.

Notice here that the number of junction voxels is different from the number of junctions since some junction voxels can be neighbors of each other.
