== General Description ==

The ImageJ Shape Filter Plugin uses the [https://github.com/thorstenwagner/ij-blob [ij-blob]] library to filter objects in binary scenes by its shape.

= Shape Features =

* Area (<math>A</math>): The area enclosed by the outer contour of an object.
* Area Convex Hull (<math>C</math>): The area enclosed by the convex hull of the outer contour of an object.
* Perimeter (<math>P</math>): The perimeter of the outer contour of an object.
* Perimeter Convex Hull (<math>H</math>): The perimeter of the convex hull of the particle.
* Feret Diameter: The maximum distance between the two parallel tangents touching the particle outline in all directions.
* Min. Feret Diameter: the minimum distance between the two parallel tangents touching the particle outline in all directions.
* Long Side Minimum Bounding Rectangle: The larger side of the minimum bounding rectangle.
* Short Side Minimum Bounding Rectangle: The smaller side of the minimum bounding rectangle.
* Aspect Ratio: Defined as <math>L/S</math>
* Area to Perimeter Ratio: Defined as <math>A/P</math>
