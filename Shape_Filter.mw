= General Description =

The ImageJ Shape Filter Plugin use the [https://github.com/thorstenwagner/ij-blob [ij-blob]] library to characterize and filter objects in binary scenes by its shape. Therefore, several features are calculated as shown below.

== Shape Features ==

* '''Area''' (<math>A</math>): The area enclosed by the outer contour of an object.
* '''Area Convex Hull''' (<math>C</math>): The area enclosed by the convex hull of the outer contour of an object.
* '''Perimeter''' (<math>P</math>): The perimeter of the outer contour of an object.
* '''Perimeter Convex Hull''' (<math>H</math>): The perimeter of the convex hull of the particle.
* '''Feret Diameter''': The maximum distance between the two parallel tangents touching the particle outline in all directions.
* '''Min. Feret Diameter''': the minimum distance between the two parallel tangents touching the particle outline in all directions.
* '''Max. Inscr. Circle Diameter''': The diameter of the maximum inscribed circle.
* '''Area eq. circle diameter''': Equivalent circle diameter <math>2\sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi}}</math>
* '''Long Side Minimum Bounding Rectangle''' (<math>L</math>): The larger side of the minimum bounding rectangle.
* '''Short Side Minimum Bounding Rectangle''' (<math>S</math>): The smaller side of the minimum bounding rectangle.
* '''Aspect Ratio''': Defined as <math>L/S</math>
* '''Area to Perimeter Ratio''': Defined as <math>A/P</math>
* '''Circularity''': Defined as <math>P^{2}/A</math>
* '''Elongation''': Defined as <math>1 - S/L</math>
* '''Convexity''': Defined as <math>H/P</math>
* '''Solidity''': Defined as <math>A/C</math>
* '''Number of Holes''': The number of holes inside an object.
* '''Thinnes Ratio''': Inverse proportional to the circularity. Furthermore it normed. It is defined as <math>4\pi A/P^{2}</math>
* '''Contour Temperatur''': It has a strong relationship to the fractal dimension, defined as <math>\left(log_{2}\left(\frac{2P}{P-H}\right)\right)^{-1}</math>
* '''Orientation''': The orientation of the major axis from in grad (measured counter clockwise from the positive x axis).
* '''Fractal Box Dimension''': Estimated fractal dimension by the box count algorithm. The default box-sizes are “2,3,4,6,8,12,16,32,64”.
