These screencasts are from very early versions of the plugin, but may still be of some use since all the functionality is still present.

This next video demonstrates more of the functionality that I added at Janelia Farm, in particular the fitting of centre lines and the filling-out of neurons.  I use Benjamin Schmid's [3D Viewer] in this demo for visualizing the results, and as an example export the mesh and load it into Blender at the end - thanks to Albert Cardona for his advice on all matters Blender.
