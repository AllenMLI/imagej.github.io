One of the most useful functions of ImageJ (and therefore Fiji) is the ''Command Launcher'' (also known as ''Command Finder''). The keyboard shortcut is ''Control+L'' (or ''Command+L'' on Macs).

Once the window opens, just type part of the menu item you want to launch, and it will show you a list of commands that match that substring:

If you are not quite sure about the spelling, just click on the ''Fuzzy matching'' checkbox:

If you want to know what menu the entries are in, or from which .jar files they come, enable the ''full information'':
