Fiji comes as a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_application portable application]. That means that you do not have to install it; just download, unpack and start it.

First, go to Fiji's [[Main_Page|home page]]:

After clicking on the ''Downloads'' link, select the appropriate .zip file:

When asked, you can tell the web browser to open the file right away:

Now, select ''Extract All...'' from the ''File'' menu of the window which just popped up:

The extraction wizard will ask you for a destination on the second page; you should not use the default (which is a temporary directory), but select something like ''Desktop'' instead:

At the end, the extraction wizard will ask you if it should open the directory which contains the extracted files.  Say yes, and open the extracted directory ''Fiji.app'':

You can start [[Main_Page|Fiji]] by double-clicking on the ''fiji-win32'' executable (on 64-bit systems, it is ''fiji-win64'').

Next time you want to start Fiji, just open the ''Fiji.app'' directory on your desktop and double-click on the executable.  To make things easier, you might want to create a shortcut to that executable and put it on the Desktop, into the Start menu, or into the QuickLaunch bar.

==Caution: "Program Files" not recommended!==
We strongly recommend that you store your Fiji.app directory somewhere in your user space (e.g., "C:\Users\[your name]\Fiji.app") rather than in "C:\Program Files" or other system-wide directory. If you move Fiji.app to such a directory, modern versions of Windows will deny Fiji write permission to its own directory structure, preventing it from being able to update.
