This article explains how to install and configure IntelliJ IDEA for use with [[ImageJ]] development. Directions correspond to IntelliJ IDEA 11.1, and may need adjustment for other versions.

== Install and configure IDEA ==

* '''Install Java Development Kit.''' Download and install Java SE 8 from the [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/ Java web site]. Or install it via a package manager, if possible.

* '''Install IDEA.''' Download and install IDEA from the [http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/ IDEA web site].

== Import the ImageJ source ==
 
# From the IDEA menu, choose {{bc|Version Control|Checkout from Version Control|Git}}
# For the Git Repository URL, enter: <code>git://github.com/imagej/imagej</code>
# Specify a Parent Directory, click Clone, and wait
# When prompted, click Yes to create an IntelliJ IDEA project from the sources
 
On some platforms, the first time you perform this procedure, you may be prompted to select the project JDK:

# Click the plus sign and choose "JSDK"
# Navigate to the directory containing your JDK installation

== Launch the program ==
 
# Choose {{bc|Run|Edit Configurations}} from the menu
# Click the Plus icon and choose Application
# In the Name field, type "ImageJ"
# Type "net.imagej.Main" for the Main class
# For "Use classpath and JDK of module" select "imagej" from the list
# Click OK
# Choose {{bc|Run|Run 'ImageJ'}} from the menu
 
The project automatically builds before launching, so it may take a little while the first time.
