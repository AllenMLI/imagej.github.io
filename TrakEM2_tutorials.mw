[[Image:Screenshot-TrakEM2_basics_tutorial.png|thumb|250px|link=TrakEM2 basics tutorial|TrakEM2 basic tutorial]]

This is the basic tutorial for TrakEM2. '''If you are new to TrakEM2, please start by watching this tutorial'''. It includes:

* Importing an image stack.
* Registering stack slices manually, using color overlays and affine transforms.
* Defining a template tree structure for your segmentations.
* Segmenting cells across multiple sections.
* 3D visualization.

* How to use the PEN tool with "area lists" segmentation type (paint an area, flood-fill, erase, flood-erase).
* How to use ROIs (selections like polygon and freeroi) to edit "area lists".

This video tutorial is focused on:

* Automatically registering sections.
* Selecting feature extraction parameters.

== Video tutorial on manual segmentation modes ==

[[Image:Screenshot-TrakEM2-Manual-Segmentation-Modes-Tutorial.png|thumb|250px|link=TrakEM2_segmentation_modes_tutorial|TrakEM2 manual segmentation modes]]

How to manually segment cells using the 3 segmentation modes:

; Overlap
: multiple arealists can coexist in space (the normal mode; arealists are independent).
; Exclude
: when painting in an arealist, do not allow paint to ocurr over any other existing arealist.
; Erode
: when painting in an arealist, paint in the current but erase any other arealist.

In this video tutorial you will learn how to:

* Extract information from TrakEM2 project objects.
* Save measurements into files.

See also [http://www.ini.uzh.ch/~acardona/trakem2_manual.html#measure_arealist AreaList measurements] in the TrakEM2 manual, with figures.

== Video tutorial on adding sections/layers to an existing project ==

[[Image:Screenshot-TrakEM2-tutorial-add-layers.png|thumb|250px|link=TrakEM2 add more sections/layers tutorial|TrakEM2 adding layers to existing project]]

Here you will learn how to:

* Open an image sequence as a virtual stack in Fiji.
* Calibrate the virtual stack.
* Import the virtual stack into TrakEM2 as a sequence of layers (sections), one image per layer.

In the tutorial, the layers are imported following an existing set of layers, i.e. concatenating to enlarge the collection of sections.
