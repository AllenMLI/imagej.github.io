[[Image:Screenshot-TrakEM2_basics_tutorial.png|thumb|250px|TrakEM2 basic tutorial]]

This is the basic tutorial for TrakEM2. '''If you are new to TrakEM2, please start by watching this tutorial'''. It includes:
*Importing an image stack.
*Registering stack slices manually, using color overlays and affine transforms.
*Defining a template tree structure for your segmentations.
*Segmenting cells across multiple sections.
*3D visualization.

*How to use the PEN tool with "area lists" segmentation type (paint an area, flood-fill, erase, flood-erase).
*How to use ROIs (selections like polygon and freeroi) to edit "area lists".

===[[TrakEM2_segmentation_modes_tutorial|Video tutorial on manual segmentation modes]]===
[[Image:Screenshot-TrakEM2-Manual-Segmentation-Modes-Tutorial.png|thumb|250px|TrakEM2 manual segmentation modes]]
How to manually segment cells using the 3 segmentation modes:

* '''Overlap''': multiple arealists can coexist in space (the normal mode; arealists are independent).
* '''Exclude''': when painting in an arealist, do not allow paint to ocurr over any other existing arealist.
* '''Erode''': when painting in an arealist, paint in the current but erase any other arealist.

===[[TrakEM2 add more sections/layers tutorial | Video tutorial on adding sections/layers to an existing project]]===
[[Image:Screenshot-TrakEM2-tutorial-add-layers.png|thumb|250px|TrakEM2 adding layers to existing project]]
Here you will learn how to:
*Open an image sequence as a virtual stack in Fiji.
*Calibrate the virtual stack.
*Import the virtual stack into TrakEM2 as a sequence of layers (sections), one image per layer.

In the tutorial, the layers are imported following an existing set of layers, i.e. concatenating to enlarge the collection of sections.
