== Summary ==
Left Panel: This panel shown the input data for the Hough circle transform.  The data includes (clockwise from top left) a circle (radius 37 pixels), a square (length 37 pixels), an ellipse (minor axis 37 pixels), and a sectored circle (radius 37 pixels).

Right Panel: This panel shows the output of a 24 step Hough circle transform.  As you can see, the circle and the sectored circle converge to local maxima, while the square and ellipse do not, show the specificity of the transform for circular objects.
