Direct access to the SNT API from the [https://www.python.org/ Python] programming language is made possible with the [https://pypi.org/project/pyimagej/ pyimagej] module. This enables full integration between SNT and any library in the Python ecosystem.
==Getting Started==
To initialize Fiji from Python:
<source lang="python">
import imagej
ij = imagej.init('sc.fiji:fiji')
</source>
Then, import the SNT classes you will need. For example, to download a neuron reconstruction from the MouseLight database, you would import the MouseLightLoader class:
<source lang="python">
MouseLightLoader = autoclass('tracing.io.MouseLightLoader')
</source>
