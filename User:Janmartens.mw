I studied Bioinformatics at Saarland University where I learned about ImageJ from his colleagues in the department of Biophyics.<br>
While I was working as a developer for web platforms at the [http://wwwen.uni.lu/lcsb/research/bioinformatics_core/ LCSB], I satisfied my passion for anything image analysis-related in my spare time.<br>
Intending to close the gap between [http://opencv.org/ OpenCV] and ImageJ, I developed the plugin [https://github.com/m4dguy/CVForge CVForge] which is currently in maintenance mode.<br>
At the moment, I work at the [http://www.gia.rwth-aachen.de/ Geodetic Institute] of RWTH Aachen where I process and analyze point cloud and imaging data.
