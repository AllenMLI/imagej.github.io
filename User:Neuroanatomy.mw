This account is used to manage the [http://sites.imagej.net/Neuroanatomy/ Neuroanatomy update site],  distributing hIPNAT (''Image Processing for NeuroAnatomy and Tree-like Structures'') plugins.

===== Requirements =====
The requirements to run the Neuroanatomy suite of plugins are twofold: i) [[Fiji]] (i.e., an ImageJ installation subscribed to the Fiji update site) and ii) Java 8 (as part of an active effort to [[2015-12-22_-_The_road_to_Java_8|modernize ImageJ]]). If you are running an older version of Java, you can either i) [[Fiji/Downloads|Download the latest Fiji release]] (newer releases come pre-bundled with Java 8); or ii) If you have downloaded Fiji while ago and want to keep your existing installation, you will have to download Java 8 and make your [[Troubleshooting#Checking_the_Java_version|Fiji installation aware of it]].

===== Subscribing to the Neuroanatomy update site =====
# Run [[Update_Sites|{{bc|Help|Update...}}]]
# Click ''Manage update sites''
# Select the ''Neuroanatomy'' checkbox
# Click ''Apply changes'' and Restart ImageJ.
