'''BAR''': Collection of '''B'''roadly '''A'''pplicable '''R'''outines.

The collection contains [[Macros]], [[Scripts]] and [[Plugins]] focused on Data Analysis, Image Annotation, Image Segmentation and Bitmap Morphometry. It is curated using [https://github.com/tferr/Scripts GitHub] and distributed as an optional [[List_of_update_sites|update site]].

== Installation ==
The easiest way is to install and maintain the collection is to subscribe to the BAR update site. By doing so you will not need to manually download and install anything: the [[Fiji Updater]] will take care of it for you:<br>
Run <span style="border-bottom:1px dotted #ccc;">Help▷ Update...</span> Choose ''Advance Mode'' then ''Manage update sites''. Activate the ''BAR'' checkbox in the alphabetically-sorted list of update sites. Press ''OK'', then ''Apply changes''. Restart ImageJ. That's it. Enjoy BAR!

Alternatively, if you prefer to manually install and update the collection, you can do so through [https://github.com/tferr/Scripts GitHub]: either by downloading individual files, or by downloading the entire repository as a [https://github.com/tferr/Scripts/archive/master.zip ZIP archive].

== Description ==
BAR files are accessible through a dedicated top-level menu subdivided in task-oriented categories. Some of the routines have a dedicated documentation page, others feature built-in help while a handful were deemed too simple to require dedicated instructions. Nevertheless, all files are described in the ''Details'' panel of the Fiji Updater and contain useful commentary at the top of the source code file.

<div style="float:center;
        border: 1px solid #ccc;
        padding: 5px !important;
        text-align:center;
        margin-top: 1em;
        margin-bottom: 2em;
        background-color: #ffefbe;
        {{border-radius|.75em}}{{box-shadow}}">
'''Tip:''' You can open any BAR script by holding {{key press|Shift}} while selecting its name from the <span style="border-bottom:1px dotted #ccc;">BAR▷</span> drop-down menu.</div>
