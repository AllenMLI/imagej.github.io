When calling '''BigStitcher > BigStitcher''' from the Fiji plugins menu, it will open a macro-scriptable dialog that looks as following:

[[File:BigStitcher_importer_1.png|thumb|300px|Select the importer and the name of the xml file to save the metadata to.]]
In order to '''define a new dataset''', please click the respective button on the left side of the dialog. This will open a new window in which you can define how to import the image data. Since there is huge variety of data formats produced by various microscopy companies and self-built setups, we developed multiple types of importers:
* '''[[BigStitcher_AutoLoader|Automatic Loader (Bioformats)]]'''

The Automatic Loader is a comprehensive importer that should work with most of image data. We highly suggest using this importer as a first choice, and just if you experience any problems to continue with one of the other options.

* '''[[BigStitcher_StackLoader|Manual Loader (Bioformats)]]'''

The '''Manual Loader (Bioformats)''' can be used to import datasets that consist of several stacks that can be opened using LOCI Bioformats. Manual asignment of the stacks to Angles, Tiles or Illuminations according to patterns in the filename is necessary.

* '''[[BigStitcher_StackLoader|Manual Loader (TIFF only, ImageJ Opener)]]'''

The '''Manual Loader (TIFF only, ImageJ Opener))''' can be used to import datasets that consist of several stacks that can be opened directly by ImageJ. Manual asignment of the stacks to Channels, Illuminations, Agles, Tiles or Illuminations according to patterns in the filename is necessary.

* '''[[BigStitcher_SpecialLoaders|Zeiss Lightsheet Z.1 Dataset (Bioformats)]]'''

A single-purpose loader to import CZI-files produced by the '''Zeiss Lightsheet Z.1 microscope'''.

* '''[[BigStitcher_SpecialLoaders|MicroManager diSPIM Dataset]]'''

A single-purpose loader to import '''diSPIM''' datasets produced by MicroManager.

''Note: Only one xml per directory is supported right now, even if they have a different filename. ''

*Open BigStitcher from the Plugin menu. In the " Select dataset for Stitching Explorer" select "define a new dataset". 
[[File:BigStitcher_Import_1.png|center]]
*Select the type of multi-view dataset and specify desired filename
 [[File:BigStitcher_Import_2.png|center]]
*BigStitcher can recognize different types of datasets:
** Image Stacks (LOCI Bioformats)
*** to open non TIFF images
** Zeiss Lightsheet Z.1 Dataset
*** opens Zeiss data
** Auto from list of files (LOCI Biofomrats)
*** open data by using wildcards or manually choosing a folder
----
Define dataset using the '''Auto from list of files (LOCI Bioformats)'''

*Choose if you want to select your files using a wildcard or all files in a specific folder. If you selected the wildcard option (*) you can use a wildcard to define your filename pattern.
[[File:BigStitcher_import_3.png|center]] 
In the example below the wildcard was used to load only all files named "D3956_HHHEGFP_*". In this case 2 files where found in the directory with the corresponding pattern.
[[File:BigStitcher_import_4.png|center]]

*BigStitcher will try to automatically to assign the right attributes found in the file. You can also assign the correct value of the wildcards you specified before. These can be:
**TimePoints
**Channels
**Illuminations
**Tiles
**Angles
[[File:BigStitcher_import_5.png|center]] 
For the example above the numerical pattern represents different angles. Therefore, the numerical pattern is set to "Angles".
* In the "Saving options" you can specify the imglib2 container to be used (the program will be automatically select the appropriate option) and you can specify the path where the dataset will be stored.Now you can choose to resave the data to HDF5 "resave as HDF5" or continue to view it in the BigDataViewer. We recommend to resave the data as HDF5 before. 
[[File:BigStitcher_import_6.png|center]] 
*If you selected the "resave as HDF5" option you given further resaving options. It`is recommended to use deflate compression to save disk space.
