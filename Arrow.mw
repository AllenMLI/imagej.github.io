==Usage==

Draws an arrow at the location of the current straight line selection using the current color and line width. The arrow will be "burnt" in the image (not a floating selection).


You can change the color and line width via ''Edit > Options > Line Width'' and ''Edit > Options > Colors''. The ''Foreground'' option in the latter will change the color of the arrow.
