A little [[Snakuscule]] snake snaked its way into Fiji! [http://bigwww.epfl.ch/algorithms.html Amongst other plugins], the good people from the [http://bigwww.epfl.ch Biomedical Imaging Group] of the EPFL in Switzerland kindly permitted us to redistribute the Snakuscule plugin!

After updating Fiji, you will find the menu item ''Plugins {{arrow}} Segmentation {{arrow}} Snakuscule''. After clicking on it, you will see two concentric circles on your image -- the Snakuscule. After putting it roughly into a place of a blob-like structure in your image, clicking on the optimization button in the toolbar will fit the Snakuscule to the structure in the image as well as possible.
